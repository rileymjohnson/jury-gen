  "case_facts": "Jennifer Gold and Roger Gold were siblings who formed South Miami Hose and Fittings LLC as 50/50 business partners in February 2021, following their father Richard Gold's retirement from a similar business. Roger Gold had worked in their father's company since 2003, while Jennifer Gold joined in 2018. The company's gross revenue grew from $273,051 in 2021 to $410,737 in 2022, with projected revenue of approximately $517,000 in 2023.\n\nIn August 2023, the siblings agreed to separate and close the business after Roger Gold expressed concerns about Jennifer Gold's limited contribution to operations. According to Roger's counterclaim, he handled the majority of customers (15-20) along with sales, marketing, purchasing, inventory control, shipping, receiving, deliveries, and collections, while Jennifer primarily handled administration and two export customers. After unsuccessful attempts to sell the business as a going concern, they agreed to sell the company's assets. The asset sale generated approximately $70,000 in proceeds for each partner.\n\nThe business dissolution led to legal disputes between the siblings. Jennifer Gold made an unauthorized withdrawal of approximately $32,000 from company accounts, believing she had not received her fair share of the proceeds. She subsequently filed suit in Miami-Dade County Court (Case No. 2024-036019-CC-26) seeking $50,000 in damages, claiming Roger Gold had improperly taken control of approximately 80% of the business's domestic clients, removed merchandise, conducted unauthorized transactions, and damaged her reputation. Roger Gold countersued, denying all allegations and asserting that Jennifer Gold had breached their partnership agreement by failing to contribute equally to the business and taking more than her rightful share of proceeds. He claimed she received approximately $18,000 in distributions beyond her fair share and sought damages for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion. A separate case with Dade County Federal Credit Union resulted in Jennifer Gold agreeing to pay $2,500 to settle a $27,951.63 judgment in January 2024.",
