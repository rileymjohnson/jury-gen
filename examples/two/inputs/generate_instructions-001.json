  "case_facts": "The case involved Millin A. Nobregas (plaintiff) and Virginia Hadad Gonzalez (defendant). From approximately May 2007 through June 2008, Nobregas attended weekly mental health counseling sessions with Gonzalez at her home, paying $60 per session. Gonzalez claimed to have a medical doctorate degree and provided counseling services to Nobregas, who was an attorney and sought counseling on the recommendation of a mutual friend and his ex-girlfriend. Documentation from the Florida Department of Health later issued a Cease and Desist notice to Gonzalez on August 8, 2013, and the Florida Certification Board's records were requested as part of the proceedings.\n\nThe relationship became contentious when Gonzalez began counseling Nobregas's ex-girlfriend, Veronica Fazzio, who was the mother of his child. Nobregas alleged that Gonzalez disclosed confidential information from his counseling sessions, while Gonzalez maintained that any information she received either came from third parties or was disclosed in the presence of others. In July 2012, Gonzalez filed a child abuse complaint against Nobregas with the Florida Department of Children and Families, which was dismissed. She also filed a Florida Bar complaint against him alleging assault after her deposition, which was also dismissed.\n\nNobregas sued Gonzalez for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, invasion of privacy, negligence, and violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. He sought damages for emotional distress, damage to his reputation, interference with his parental rights, and legal defense costs. Medical experts, including Dr. Mark Barnett (psychiatrist) and Dr. Adriana Rosen (Ph.D.), were prepared to testify about Nobregas's mental condition and how Gonzalez's actions caused and aggravated his condition, including the need for new medication. Gonzalez denied most allegations in her answer and raised multiple affirmative defenses, including that Nobregas had given permission to disclose information, that she was privileged to make any alleged disclosures, and that Nobregas's claims should be barred due to unclean hands.",
