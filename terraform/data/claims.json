Donovon , 99 Fla. 1296, 1306 (Fla. 1930) (\u201can injunction against the breach of a contract is a negative decree of specific performance of the agreement, and the general rule is that the power and the duty of a court of equity to grant the former is measured by the same rules and practice as its power and duty to grant the latter relief.\u201d); Thompson v. Shell Petroleum Corp. , 130 Fla. 652 (Fla. 1938) (\u201cAn injunction restraining the breach of a contract is a negative specific enforcement of that contract.

(8) Anticipatory Breach of Contract : A party that has repudiated its obligations under a contract cannot seek specific performance, as \u201canticipatory repudiation relieves the non-breaching party of its duty to further perform and creates in it an immediate cause of action for breach of contract.\u201d Twenty-Four Collection, Inc. v.

Health Coalition, Inc. , 687 So.2d 329, 333 (Fla. 3d DCA 1997) .

City of Jacksonville , 659 So.2d 1046, 1047 (Fla. 1995) (advancing a merely colorable claim is not enough to show a substantial likelihood of success). (12) \u201cMandatory injunctions \u2013 [which require that a defendant do some positive act or that acts be undone] \u2013 are looked upon with disfavor, and the courts seem even more reluctant to issue them than prohibitory ones.\u201d Shaw v.

(15) In addition to satisfaction of prima facie elements, Florida courts must also consider the following in determining whether to grant injunctive relief: (a) the nature of the interest to be protected, (b) the relative adequacy to the plaintiff of injunction and of other remedies, (c) any unreasonable delay by the plaintiff in bringing suit, (d) any related misconduct on the part of the plaintiff, (e) the relative hardship likely to result to defendant if an injunction is granted and to plaintiff if it is denied, (f) the interests of third persons and of the public, and (g) the practicability of framing and enforcing the order or judgment\u2019\u2019.

Karr , 697 So.2d 887 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997) .
