        "notes_on_use": "1. This instruction endeavors to explain to the jury that this principle should be secondary to the consideration of other means of interpretation, principally the consideration of parol evidence that may explain the parties' intent at the time they entered into the contract. See W. Yellow Pine Co. v. Sinclair, 90 So. 828, 831 (Fla. 1922) (the rule to construe against the drafter should not be used if other rules of construction reach the intent of the parties); The School Bd. of Broward Cnty. v. The Great Am. Ins. Co., 807 So. 2d 750 (Fla. 4th DCA 2002) (the rule to construe against the drafter is a secondary rule of interpretation and should be used as a last resort when all ordinary interpretive guides have been exhausted); DSL Internet Corp. v. TigerDirect, Inc., 907 So. 2d 1203, 1205 (Fla. 3d DCA 2005) (the against-the-drafter rule is a rule of last resort and is inapplicable if there is evidence of the parties' intent). There is a risk that the jury may place too much emphasis on this rule, to the exclusion of evidence and other approaches; therefore, this instruction should be given with caution. One district court of appeal has held that express contractual provisions prohibiting use of this principle must be enforced. See Agile Assur. Group, Ltd. v. Palmer, 147 So. 3d 1017 (Fla. 2d DCA 2014).\n\n2. If the contract at issue or an applicable statute provides that the contract will not be construed against the drafter, the Committee would suggest that this be taken into consideration before this instruction is used, particularly given the secondary rule of interpretation principle expressed in the preceding paragraph and established Florida law that every provision in a contract should be given meaning and effect. See Excelsior Ins. Co. v. Pomona Park Bar & Package Store, 369 So. 2d 938, 941 (Fla. 1979) (holding that every provision in a contract should be given meaning); see also section 542.335(1)(h), Florida Statutes (providing an example in the context of not construing a restrictive covenant against the drafter).\n\n3. The Committee strongly recommends the use of this instruction in connection with a verdict form that clarifies, by special interrogatory, what the term or phrase is that the court has declared to be ambiguous. See First Nat'l Bank of Lake Park v. Gay, 694 So. 2d 784, 789 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997) (discussing that interrogatory verdict forms should track the same issues and defenses in the jury instructions)."

When the consumer expectation test is used to define a product defect in a case involving an injury to a bystander or someone not directly using the product, the instruction should be modified to inform the jury that the relevant \"ordinary consumer\" is the professional or other type of consumer who actually used the allegedly defective product. See Cavanaugh, 308 So. 3d at 156.\n\n2.\tForeseeability of injured bystander. Strict liability applies to all foreseeable bystanders. When the injured person is a bystander, use the language \"a person in the vicinity of the product\" instead of \"the user.\"  Strict liability does not depend on whether the defendant foresaw the particular bystander's presence. See West v. Caterpillar Tractor Co. Inc., 336 So. 2d 80, 89 (Fla. 1976) (\"Injury to a  bystander is often feasible. A restriction of the doctrine to the users and consumers would have to rest on the vestige of the disappearing privity requirement.\").  See also Sanchez v. Hussey Seating Co., 698 So. 2d 1326 (Fla. 1st DCA 1997). When there is an issue regarding whether the presence of bystanders was foreseeable, additional instructions may be needed.\n\n3.\tWhen strict liability and negligence claims are tried together, to clarify differences between them it may be necessary to add language to the strict liability instructions to the effect that a product is defective if unreasonably dangerous even though the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product. Restatement (Second) Torts, \u00a7 402A(2)(a). In cases involving claims of both negligence and defective design, submission of both claims may result in an inconsistent verdict. See, e.g., Consolidated Aluminum Corp. v. Braun, 447 So. 2d 391 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984); Ashby Division of Consolidated Aluminum Corp. v. Dobkin, 458 So. 2d 335 (Fla. 3d DCA 1984). See also Coba v.

American Safety Equip., 594 So. 2d 795 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).\n\n4.\tIn some cases, it may be appropriate to instruct the jury that, in addition to the designer and manufacturer, any distributor, importer, or seller in the chain of distribution is liable for injury caused by a defective product.  Samuel Friedland Family Enterprises v. Amoroso, 630 So. 2d 1067 (Fla. 1994); Rivera v. Baby Trend, Inc., 914 So. 2d 1102 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005); Porter v.

Extreme and outrageous conduct may be a legal cause of severe emotional distress even though it operates in combination with [the act of another] [some natural cause] [or] [some other cause] if the extreme and outrageous conduct contributes substantially to producing such severe emotional distress.\n\nc.\tIntervening cause:\n\nDo not use the bracketed first sentence if this instruction is preceded by the instruction on concurring cause:*\n\n*[In order to be regarded as a legal cause of severe emotional distress, extreme and outrageous conduct need not be its only cause.] Extreme and outrageous conduct may also be a legal cause of severe emotional distress even though it operates in combination with [the act of another] [some natural cause] [or] [some other cause] occurring after the extreme and outrageous conduct occurs if [such other cause was itself reasonably foreseeable and the extreme and outrageous conduct contributes substantially to producing such severe emotional distress] [or] [the resulting severe emotional distress was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the extreme and outrageous conduct and the extreme and outrageous conduct contributes substantially to producing it].",
        "notes_on_use": "1.\tInstruction 410.6a (legal cause generally) is to be given in all cases. Instruction 410.6b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether outrageous conduct was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his outrageous conduct by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 410.6c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tThe jury will properly consider instruction 410.6a not only in determining whether defendant's outrageous conduct is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's conduct contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3. \tInstruction 410.6b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries/multiple events, instruction 501.5a or b should be given as well. See Hart v. Stern, 824 So. 2d 927, 929\u201332 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002); Marinelli v. Grace, 608 So. 2d 833, 834\u201335 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).\n\n4.\tInstruction 410.6c (intervening cause) embraces two situations in which outrageous conduct may be a legal cause notwithstanding the influence of an intervening cause: (1) when the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the outrageous conduct although the other cause was not foreseeable, Mozer v. Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Gibson v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., 386 So. 2d 520 (Fla. 1980).\n\n5.\t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be instructed that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the outrageous conduct. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts 291 (3d ed.); 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts 1137.\n\n6.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the instruction to describe the extent of contribution or influence outrageous conduct must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937).\n\n(Revised December 4, 2024.)"

If you find for (claimant) and against (defendant(s)), you must decide whether, in addition to compensatory damages, punitive damages are warranted as punishment to [one or more of] (defendant(s)) and as a deterrent to others.\nThe trial of the punitive damages issue is divided into two parts. In this first part, you will decide whether the conduct of (defendant(s) or individual(s) whose conduct may warrant punitive damages) is such that punitive damages are warranted. If you decide that punitive damages are warranted, we will proceed to the second part of that issue during which the parties may present additional evidence and argument on the issue of punitive damages. I will then give you additional instructions, after which you will decide whether, in your discretion, punitive damages will be assessed and, if so, the amount.\nb(1).\tPunitive damages for acts of an individual defendant:\n(Claimant) claims that punitive damages should be awarded against (defendant) for [his] [her] [its] conduct in (describe the alleged punitive conduct).

Under those circumstances you may, in your discretion, award punitive damages against (employee/agent). If clear and convincing evidence does not show such conduct by (employee/agent), punitive damages are not warranted against either (employee/agent) or (defendant employer).  \nIf you find that punitive damages are warranted against (employee/agent) you may also, in your discretion, award punitive damages against (defendant employer) if you find from clear and convincing evidence that:\n(A).\t(defendant employer) actively and knowingly participated in such conduct of (employee/agent); or\n(B).\tthe [officers] [directors] [or] [managers] of (defendant employer) knowingly condoned, ratified, or consented to such conduct of (employee/agent); or\n(C).\t(defendant employer) engaged in conduct that constituted gross negligence and that contributed to the [loss] [damage] [or] [injury] to (claimant).\nIf clear and convincing evidence does not show such conduct by (defendant employer) punitive damages are not warranted against (defendant employer).\n[\u201cIntentional misconduct\u201d means that (person whose conduct may warrant punitive damages) had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of the conduct and there was a high probability of injury or damage to (claimant) and, despite that knowledge, [he] [she] intentionally pursued that course of conduct, resulting in injury or damage.]\n[\u201cGross negligence\u201d means that the conduct of (person whose conduct may warrant punitive damages) was so reckless or wanting in care that it constituted a conscious disregard or indifference to the life, safety, or rights of persons exposed to such conduct.]\n[\u201cClear and convincing evidence\u201d differs from the \u201cgreater weight of the evidence\u201d in that it is more compelling and persuasive.

When I finish with these instructions, the parties will present additional evidence.  You should consider this additional evidence along with the evidence presented, and you should decide any disputed factual issues by the greater weight of the evidence. \u201cGreater weight of the evidence\u201d means the more persuasive and convincing force and effect of the entire evidence in the case.\nc(2).\tPunitive damages \u2014 determination of amount:\nYou are to decide the amount of punitive damages, if any, to be assessed as punishment against (defendant(s)) and as a deterrent to others. This amount would be in addition to the compensatory damages you have previously awarded.

Your verdict on the issues raised by the punitive damages claim of (claimant) against (defendant(s)) must be based on the evidence that has been received during the trial of the first phase of this case and on the evidence that has been received in these proceedings and the law on which I have instructed you. In reaching your verdict, you are not to be swayed from the performance of your duty by prejudice or sympathy for or against any party.\nYour verdict must be unanimous, that is, your verdict must be agreed to by each of you.\nYou will be given a form of verdict, which I shall now read to you:\nWhen you have agreed on your verdict, the foreperson, acting for the jury, should date and sign the verdict.

        "notes_on_use": "\n1.\tThis instruction is designed so it can be given before the taking of evidence. Instruction 503.1a and the applicable part of 503.1b should be given as part of the general instruction on the case. Instruction 503.1c is designed to be given before the beginning of stage two of the punitive damages trial. And instruction 503.1d is designed to be given at the close of the evidence in the stage two proceeding.\n2.\tInstruction 503.1a should be given in all cases involving bifurcated proceedings.\nInstruction 503.1b(1) should be given when the demand for punitive damages is based on the conduct of an individual defendant.\nInstruction 503.1b(2) should be given when the demand for punitive damages is based on the conduct of a managing agent or principal. Bankers Multiple Line Insurance Co. v. Farish, 464 So. 2d 530 (Fla. 1985). That person should be named in 503.1b(2). Pending further development in the law, the committee takes no position regarding whether the independent negligence must be on the part of a managing agent or principal or whether it can be based on the independent negligence of another employee. See Schropp v. Crown Eurocars, Inc., 654 So. 2d 1158 (Fla. 1995) and Partington v. Metallic Engineering, 792 So. 2d 498 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). In appropriate cases, a corporate policy can provide the basis for punitive damages against a corporation even though the particular officers or agents of the corporation responsible for the policy are not discovered or identified. See, e.g., Schropp at 1162 (Wells, J. concurring). In those cases, the instruction will need to be modified accordingly.\nInstruction 503.1b(3) should be given when there is a demand for punitive damages against an employer/principal based on the conduct of an employee and punitive damages are also being sought against the employee. There may be situations other than employer-employee relationships where vicarious liability for punitive damages may be imposed. See, e.g., Knepper v. Genstar Corp., 537 So. 2d 619 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988) (joint venture); Soden v. Starkman, 218 So. 2d 763 (Fla. 3d DCA 1969) (partnership).\nInstruction 503.1b(4) should be given when there is a demand for punitive damages against the employer/principal for the acts of an employee, but the employee is not a defendant or is not being sued for punitive damages.\nIn cases involving both direct and vicarious liability claims, instructions 503.1b(2) and 503.1b(3) or b(4) should be given with appropriate transitional language with respect to the claims based on vicarious liability. \n\u201cIntentional misconduct\u201d and \u201cgross negligence,\u201d as well as their definitions, are bracketed in these instructions because a defendant may be found liable for punitive damages if the jury finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant was guilty of either \u201cintentional misconduct\u201d or \u201cgross negligence.\u201d See F.S. 768.72(2) (1999). Whether the jury should be instructed on \u201cintentional misconduct,\u201d \u201cgross negligence,\u201d or both, depends on the circumstances of the case. In addition, once the jury has been instructed on the definitions of \u201cintentional misconduct\u201d and \u201cgross negligence,\u201d those instructions do not have to be repeated.\nThe paragraphs in instructions 503.1b(2)\u2013b(4) defining \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d are also bracketed because, once given, that definition does not have to be repeated.\n3.\tInstructions 503.1b(1)\u2013b(4) are designed for use in most common-law tort cases. However, certain types of intentional torts may require a punitive damage charge appropriate to the particular tort. See, e.g., First Interstate Development Corp. v. Ablanedo, 511 So. 2d 536 (Fla. 1987); Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. McCarson, 467 So. 2d 277 (Fla. 1985). The same may be true when punitive damages are authorized by statute. See, e.g., Home Insurance Co. v. Owens, 573 So. 2d 343, 346 (Fla. 4th DCA 1990).\n4.\tIt is not the purpose of instruction 503.1c second stage instructions to allow parties to relitigate in the second stage of the bifurcated proceeding, by new evidence or by argument, the underlying question decided in the first stage of the proceeding of whether an award of punitive damages is warranted. Rather, the purpose of instruction 503.1c is to advise the jury that in the second stage of the proceeding, evidence may be presented and argued which will allow the jury in its discretion to determine the amount of an award of punitive damages, and that the amount which the jury determines appropriate could be zero.\n5.\tInstruction 503.1c(2)(B) should only be used when evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial worth is introduced.\n6.\tInstruction 503.1c(2)(C) should be used only after the court has determined that the evidence includes some additional circumstance that may affect the amount of punitive damages. See, e.g., Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Ballard, 749 So. 2d 483 (Fla. 1999) (listing various such factors). See generally BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996). One such circumstance is the assessment of punitive damages against the defendant in prior cases. See W.R. Grace & Co. v. Waters, 638 So. 2d 502 (Fla. 1994).\n7.\tThis instruction is to be given when requested by the defendant. See Wransky v. Dalfo, 801 So. 2d 239 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). It appears that this instruction can only be used when evidence of the defendant\u2019s net worth has been introduced. See Bould v. Touchette, 349 So. 2d 1181 (Fla. 1977); Rinaldi v. Aaron, 314 So. 2d 762 (Fla. 1975). This instruction is not intended to supplant the court\u2019s function in determining whether a verdict is constitutional. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996); Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991). The committee notes that many reported decisions have used alternative terms such as \u201cbankrupt\u201d or \u201ceconomically castigate\u201d to describe this limitation, instead of or in addition to the term \u201cfinancially destroy.\u201d See, e.g., Wackenhut Corp. v. Canty, 359 So. 2d 430 (Fla. 1978); Lehman v. Spencer Ladd\u2019s Inc., 182 So. 2d 402 (Fla. 1966). The committee has selected the term \u201cfinancially destroy\u201d for its simplicity, but does not intend to foreclose the use of other legally valid terms where appropriate under the facts of the particular case.\n8.\tHarm and risk of harm to nonparties. This instruction does not address what evidence of harm to nonparties is relevant or admissible in a particular case or whether additional instructions may be necessary to ensure due process based on the evidence admitted in a particular case or a particular phase of a bifurcated trial. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 421\u201322 (2003). This instruction should be given, upon request, in cases in which evidence has been introduced that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused harm to others who are not parties to the case. See Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 355\u201357 (2007); Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Ledoux, 230 So. 3d 530, 536 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017); Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Cohen, 102 So. 3d 11, 18 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012), quashed on other grounds, 41 Fla. L. Weekly S113 (Fla. Jan. 29, 2016). Depending upon the evidence admitted in a particular case, additional language may be appropriate regarding the risk of harm the defendant\u2019s conduct posed to nonparties. See Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. at 355\u201357.\n(Revised March 4, 2020 (35 So. 3d 666);\n August 13, 2021; November 19, 2021.)\n"

        "notes_on_use": "\n1.\tThis instruction is designed so it can be given before the taking of evidence. Instruction 503.2a and the applicable part of 503.2b should be given as part of the general instruction on the case.\n2.\tInstruction 503.2a should be given in all non-bifurcated cases.\nInstruction 503.2b(1) should be given when the demand for punitive damages is based on the conduct of an individual defendant.\nInstruction 503.2b(2) should be given when the demand for punitive damages is based on the conduct of a managing agent or principal. Bankers Multiple Line Insurance Co. v. Farish, 464 So. 2d 530 (Fla. 1985). That person should be named in 503.2b(2). Pending further development in the law, the committee takes no position regarding whether the independent negligence must be on the part of a managing agent or principal or whether it can be based on the independent negligence of another employee. See Schropp v. Crown Eurocars, Inc., 654 So. 2d 1158 (Fla. 1995); Partington v. Metallic Engineering, 792 So. 2d 498 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). In appropriate cases, a corporate policy can provide the basis for punitive damages against a corporation even though the particular officers or agents of the corporation responsible for the policy are not discovered or identified. See, e.g., Schropp at 1162 (Wells, J. concurring). In those cases, the instruction will need to be modified accordingly.\nInstruction 503.2b(3) should be given when there is a demand for punitive damages against an employer/principal based on the conduct of an employee and punitive damages are also being sought against both the employee and employer.  There may be situations other than employer-employee relationships where vicarious liability for punitive damages may be imposed. See, e.g., Knepper v. Genstar Corp., 537 So. 2d 619 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988) (joint venture); Soden v. Starkman, 218 So. 2d 763 (Fla. 3d DCA 1969) (partnership).\nInstruction 503.2b(4) should be given when there is a demand for punitive damages against the employer/principal for the acts of an employee, but the employee is not a defendant or is not being sued for punitive damages.\nIn cases involving both direct and vicarious liability claims, instructions 503.2b(2) and 503.2b(3) or b(4) should be given with appropriate transitional language with respect to the claims based on vicarious liability. \n\u201cIntentional misconduct\u201d and \u201cgross negligence,\u201d as well as their definitions, are bracketed in these instructions because a defendant may be found liable for punitive damages if the jury finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant was guilty of either \u201cintentional misconduct\u201d or \u201cgross negligence.\u201d See F.S. 768.72(2) (1999). Whether the jury should be instructed on \u201cintentional misconduct,\u201d \u201cgross negligence,\u201d or both depends on the circumstances of the case. In addition, once the jury has been instructed on the definitions of \u201cintentional misconduct\u201d and \u201cgross negligence,\u201d those instructions do not have to be repeated.\nThe paragraphs in instructions 503.2b(2)\u2013b(4) defining \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d are bracketed because, once given, that definition does not have to be repeated.\n3.\tInstructions 503.2b(1)\u2013b(4) are designed for use in most common-law tort cases. However, certain types of intentional torts may require a punitive damage charge appropriate to the particular tort. See, e.g., First Interstate Development Corp. v. Ablanedo, 511 So. 2d 536 (Fla. 1987); Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. McCarson, 467 So. 2d 277 (Fla. 1985). The same may be true where punitive damages are authorized by statute. See, e.g., Home Insurance Co. v. Owens, 573 So. 2d 343, 346 (Fla. 4th DCA 1990).\n4.\tInstruction 503.2c(2) should only be used when evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial worth is introduced.\n5.\tInstruction 503.2c(3) should be used only after the court has determined that the evidence includes some additional circumstance that may affect the amount of punitive damages. See, e.g., Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Ballard, 749 So. 2d 483 (Fla. 1999) (listing various such factors). See generally BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996). One such circumstance is the assessment of punitive damages against the defendant in prior cases. See W.R. Grace & Co. v. Waters, 638 So. 2d 502 (Fla. 1994).\n6.\tThis instruction is to be given when requested by the defendant. See Wransky v. Dalfo, 801 So. 2d 239 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). It appears that this instruction can only be used when evidence of the defendant\u2019s net worth has been introduced. See Bould v. Touchette, 349 So. 2d 1181 (Fla. 1977); Rinaldi v. Aaron, 314 So. 2d 762 (Fla. 1975). This instruction is not intended to supplant the court\u2019s function in determining whether a verdict is constitutional. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996); Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991). The committee notes that many reported decisions have used alternative terms such as \u201cbankrupt\u201d or \u201ceconomically castigate\u201d to describe this limitation, instead of or in addition to the term \u201cfinancially destroy.\u201d See, e.g., Wackenhut Corp. v. Canty, 359 So. 2d 430 (Fla. 1978); Lehman v. Spencer Ladd\u2019s, Inc., 182 So. 2d 402 (Fla. 1966). The committee has selected the term \u201cfinancially destroy\u201d for its simplicity, but does not intend to foreclose the use of other legally valid terms where appropriate under the facts of the particular case.\n7.\tHarm and risk of harm to nonparties. This instruction does not address what evidence of harm to nonparties is relevant or admissible in a particular case or whether additional instructions may be necessary to ensure due process based on the evidence admitted in a particular case or a particular phase of a bifurcated trial. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 421\u201322 (2003). This instruction should be given, upon request, in cases in which evidence has been introduced that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused harm to others who are not parties to the case. See Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 355\u201357 (2007); Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Ledoux, 230 So. 3d 530, 536 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017); Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Cohen, 102 So. 3d 11, 18 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012), quashed on other grounds, 41 Fla. L. Weekly S113 (Fla. Jan. 29, 2016). Depending upon the evidence admitted in a particular case, additional language may be appropriate regarding the risk of harm the defendant\u2019s conduct posed to nonparties. See Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. at 355\u201357.\n(Revised March 4, 2020 (35 So. 3d 666); August 13, 2021; November 19, 2021.)\n"

See Id. at 643\u201344 (\"A verdict is not necessarily inconsistent simply because it fails to award enough money or even no money at all.\") See also Eulen Am. v.

Stevens Markets, Inc. v. Markantonatos, 189 So. 2d 624, 626 (Fla. 1966) (citing Tobin v. Garry, 127 So. 2d 698, 700 (Fla. 2d DCA 1961) (internal citations and quotations omitted)). When a defective verdict is returned and the defect discovered before the jury is discharged, resubmission by the trial court is a legal duty, not simply a discretionary call. Morton Roofing, Inc. v. Prather, 864 So. 2d 64, 67 (Fla. 5th DCA 2003). However, the committee takes no position on whether a new verdict form should be provided to the jury.\n\n4.\tWhen a defective verdict is resubmitted by the trial court before the jury is discharged, the jury is still in control of the verdict \u2014 at liberty to review the case and to bring in an entirely new verdict. Stevens Markets 189 So. 2d at 626. The jurors, on reconsideration of their verdict on a second retirement, may amend it in substance, if they so agree, or they may submit an entirely different verdict. Id. In such an event, the entire cause remains in the hands of the jury and the jurors are not bound by their former action as a verdict which has not became final is subject to reconsideration in its entirety by the jury. Morton Roofing 864 So. 2d at 67\u201368; Tobin 127 So. 2d at 700 (\"When they [jurors] are sent back to further or reconsider the matter, the case is still in their hands. They are not bound by their former action. They are at liberty to review the case and to bring in an entirely new verdict.\"). It is within the sound discretion of the trial court whether to resubmit to the jury: the first verdict form in its entirety; a copy of the first verdict form, marked for identification purposes; a new verdict form; or a new verdict form, together with a copy of the first verdict form, marked for identification purposes.\n\n5.\tA clerical error in the verdict form which becomes apparent before the jury is polled or discharged may be resubmitted to the jury for clarification or correction.

I will also explain various rules to you that you will need to know in order to do your job as the jury.

[He] [She] is here to assist me with some of the mechanics of the trial process, including the numbering and collection of the exhibits that are introduced in the course of the trial.\n\nCourt Reporter: The person sitting at the stenographic machine, (name), is the court reporter. [His] [Her] job is to keep an accurate legal record of everything we say and do during this trial.\n\nBailiff: The person over there, (name), is the bailiff. [His] [Her] job is to maintain order and security in the courtroom. The bailiff is also my representative to the jury. Anything you need or any problems that come up for you during the course of the trial should be brought to [him] [her]. However, the bailiff cannot answer any of your questions about the case. Only I can do that.\n\nJury: Last, but not least, is the jury, which we will begin to select in a few moments from among all of you. The jury's job will be to decide what the facts are and what the facts mean. Jurors should be as neutral as possible at this point and have no fixed opinion about the lawsuit.\n\nIn order to have a fair and lawful trial, there are rules that all jurors must follow. A basic rule is that jurors must decide the case only on the evidence presented in the courtroom. You must not communicate with anyone, including friends and family members, about this case, the people and places involved, or your jury service. You must not disclose your thoughts about this case or ask for advice on how to decide this case.\n\nThe law requires that jurors consider only the testimony and other evidence presented during the trial. The law also requires that jurors keep an open mind and not discuss their opinions with other jurors until the jury retires to deliberate at the end of the case. If you are selected as a juror in this case, you cannot discuss the case with your fellow jurors before you are permitted to do so at the conclusion of the trial, or with anyone else until after a decision has been reached by the jury. Therefore, starting now, you cannot talk about the case or otherwise have any communication about the case with anyone, including your fellow jurors, until I tell you that such discussions may take place.\n\nIn addition to not having face-to-face discussions with your fellow jurors or anyone else, you must not communicate with anyone about the case in any way, whether orally or in writing, including electronically, or on the Internet through e-mail, text messaging, blogs, or social media such as (insert examples of social media platforms), or any other electronic communication whatsoever.\n\nYou also must not conduct any type of independent or personal research or investigation regarding any matters related to this case. You must not look up words, names, [maps,] or anything else that may have anything to do with this case. Do not use your cellphones or any other device to do any research regarding this case, the matters in the case, the legal issues in the case, or the individuals or entities involved in the case. And you must ignore any information about the case you might see, even accidentally, in the news media, on the Internet, or on social media. This is because you must base the decisions you will have to make in this case solely on what you hear and see in this courtroom.\n\nI want to stress again that this rule means you must not use electronic devices to communicate about this case. Do not send or accept any messages to or from anyone about this case or your jury service.\n\nThis applies whether you are in the courthouse, at home, or anywhere else.\n\nMany of you may have cell phones or other electronic devices with you here in the courtroom.**\n\n**The trial judge should select one of the following two alternative instructions explaining the rules governing jurors' use of electronic devices, as explained in Note on Use 1.\n\nAlternative A: [All cell phones, computers, tablets, or other types of electronic devices must be turned off while you are in the courtroom. Turned off means that the phone or other electronic device is actually off and not in a silent or vibrating mode. You may use these devices during recesses, but even then you may not use your cell phone or electronic device to find out any information about the case or communicate with anyone about the case or the people involved in the case. Do not take photographs, video recordings, or audio recordings of the proceedings or of your fellow jurors. After each recess, please double check to make sure your cell phone or electronic device is turned off. At the end of the case, while you are deliberating, you must not communicate with anyone outside the jury room. You cannot have in the jury room any cell phones, computers, or other electronic devices. If someone needs to contact you in an emergency, the court can receive messages and deliver them to you without delay. A contact phone number will be provided to you.]\n\nAlternative B: [You cannot have any cell phones, tablets, laptops, or other electronic devices in the courtroom. You may use these devices during recesses, but even then you may not use your cell phone or electronic device to find out any information about the case or communicate with anyone about the case or the people involved in the case. Do not take photographs, video recordings, or audio recordings of the proceedings or your fellow jurors. At the end of the case, while you are deliberating, you must not communicate with anyone outside the jury room. If someone needs to contact you in an emergency, the court can receive messages and deliver them to you without delay. A contact phone number will be provided to you.]\n\nWhat are the reasons for these rules?  These rules are imposed because jurors must decide the case without distraction and only on the evidence presented in the courtroom. If you investigate, research, or make inquiries on your own outside of the courtroom, the trial judge has no way to make sure that the information you obtain is proper for the case. The parties likewise have no opportunity to dispute or challenge the accuracy of what you find. That is contrary to our judicial system, which assures every party the right to ask questions about and challenge the evidence being considered against it and to present argument with respect to that evidence. Any independent investigation by a juror unfairly and improperly prevents the parties from having that opportunity our judicial system promises.\n\nAny juror who violates these restrictions jeopardizes the fairness of these proceedings, and a mistrial could result that would require the entire trial process to start over. A mistrial is a tremendous expense and inconvenience to the parties, the court, and the taxpayers. If you violate these rules, you may be held in contempt of court, and face sanctions, such as serving time in jail, paying a fine or both.\n\nAll of your communications with courtroom personnel, or me, will be part of the record of these proceedings. That means those communications must either be made in open court with the court reporter present or, if they are in writing, the writing will be filed with the court clerk. This means, if you are outside the courtroom, any communication with me must be in writing, unsigned, and handed directly to the bailiff. Do not share the content of the writing with anyone, including other jurors. I have instructed the courtroom personnel that any communications you have with them outside of my presence must be reported to me, and I will tell the parties [and their attorneys] about any communication from you that I believe may be of interest to the parties [and their attorneys].\n\nHowever, you may communicate directly with courtroom personnel about matters concerning your comfort and safety, such as [juror parking] [location of break areas] [how and when to assemble for duty] [dress] [what personal items can be brought into the courthouse or jury room] [list any other types of routine ex parte communications permitted].\n\nIf you become aware of any violation of these instructions or any other instruction I give in this case, you must tell me by giving a note to the bailiff.",
        "notes_on_use": "1.\tFlorida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.451 directs trial judges to instruct jurors on the use of cell phones and other electronic devices. During the trial, the trial judge may remove the jurors' cell phones or other electronic devices. The trial judge also has the option to allow the jurors to keep the cell phones and electronic devices during trial until the jurors begin deliberations. Rule 2.451 prohibits jurors from using the cell phones or electronic devices to find out information about the case or to communicate with others about the case. The jurors also cannot use the electronic devices to record, photograph, or videotape the proceedings.  In recognition of the discretion rule 2.451 gives trial judges, this instruction provides two alternatives: (A) requiring jurors to turn off electronic devices during court proceedings and removing their cell phones and electronic devices during deliberations; or (B) removing the cell phones and electronic devices during all proceedings and deliberations. These instructions may be modified to fit the practices of a trial judge in a particular courtroom. These instructions are not intended to limit the discretion of the trial court to control the proceedings.\n\n2.\tThe portion of this instruction dealing with communication with others and outside research may be modified to include other specified means of communication or research as technology develops.\n\n3.\tFlorida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.431(i)(2) requires the court, by pretrial order or statement on the record with opportunity for objection, to set forth the scope of routine, ex parte communications.  Rule 1.431(i)(3) mandates an instruction during voir dire regarding the limitations on jurors' communications with the court and courtroom personnel. The court should make sure that courtroom personnel are also aware of the limitations on their communications with jurors.\n\n4.\tThe introduction of the uninsured/underinsured motorist carrier is required because the plaintiffs are entitled to have the jury know that the joined carrier is the plaintiffs' uninsured/underinsured carrier.

        "main_paragraph": "Now [that you have heard the law,] let me explain the trail procedure.\n\nOpening Statements: In a few moments, the attorneys will each have a chance to make what are called opening statements. In an opening statement, an attorney is allowed to give you [his] [her] views about what the evidence will be in the trial and what you are likely to see and hear in the testimony.\n\nEvidentiary Phase: After the attorneys' opening statements the plaintiffs will bring their witnesses and evidence to you.\n\nEvidence: Evidence is the information that the law allows you to see or hear in deciding this case. Evidence includes the testimony of the witnesses, documents, and anything else that I instruct you to consider.\n\nWitnesses: A witness is a person who takes an oath to tell the truth and then answers attorneys' questions for the jury. The answering of attorneys' questions by witnesses is called \"giving testimony.\" Testimony means statements that are made when someone has sworn an oath to tell the truth.\n\nThe plaintiff's lawyer will normally ask a witness the questions first. That is called direct examination. Then the defense lawyer may ask the same witness additional questions about whatever the witness has testified to. That is called cross-examination. Certain documents or other evidence may also be shown to you during direct or cross-examination. After the plaintiff's witnesses have testified, the defendant will have the opportunity to put witnesses on the stand and go through the same process. Then the plaintiff's lawyer gets to do cross-examination. The process is designed to be fair to both sides.\n\nIt is important that you remember that testimony comes from witnesses. The attorneys do not give testimony and they are not themselves witnesses.\n\nObjections: Sometimes the attorneys will disagree about the rules for trial procedure when a question is asked of a witness. When that happens, one of the lawyers may make what is called an \"objection.\" The rules for a trial can be complicated, and there are many reasons for attorneys to object. You should simply wait for me to decide how to proceed. If I say that an objection is \"sustained,\" that means the witness may not answer the question. If I say that the objection is \"overruled,\" that means the witness may answer the question.\n\nWhen there is an objection and I make a decision, you must not assume from that decision that I have any particular opinion other than that the rules for conducting a trial are being correctly followed. If I say a question may not be asked or answered, you must not try to guess what the answer would have been. That is against the rules, too.\n\nSide Bar Conferences: Sometimes I will need to speak to the attorneys about legal elements of the case that are not appropriate for the jury to hear. The attorneys and I will try to have as few of these conferences as possible while you are giving us your valuable time in the courtroom. But, if we do have to have such a conference during testimony, we will try to hold the conference at the side of my desk so that we do not have to take a break and ask you to leave the courtroom.\n\nRecesses: Breaks in an ongoing trial are usually called \"recesses.\" During a recess you still have your duties as a juror and must follow the rules, even while having coffee, at lunch, or at home.\n\nInstructions Before Closing Arguments: After all the evidence has been presented to you, I will instruct you in the law that you must follow. It is important that you remember these instructions to assist you in evaluating the final attorney presentations, which come next, and, later, during your deliberations, to help you correctly sort through the evidence to reach your decision.\n\nClosing Arguments: The attorneys will then have the opportunity to make their final presentations to you, which are called closing arguments.\n\nFinal Instructions: After you have heard the closing arguments, I will instruct you further in the law as well as explain to you the procedures you must follow to decide the case.\n\nDeliberations: After you hear the final jury instructions, you will go to the jury room and discuss and decide the questions I have put on your verdict form. [You will have a copy of the jury instructions to use during your discussions.] The discussions you have and the decisions you make are usually called \"jury deliberations.\" Your deliberations are absolutely private and neither I nor anyone else will be with you in the jury room.\n\nVerdict: When you have finished answering the questions, you will give the verdict form to the bailiff, and we will all return to the courtroom where your verdict will be read. When that is completed, you will be released from your assignment as a juror.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nFinally, before we begin the trial, I want to give you just a brief explanation of rules you must follow as the case proceeds.\n\nKeeping an Open Mind: You must pay close attention to the testimony and other evidence as it comes into the trial. However, you must avoid forming any final opinion or telling anyone else your views on the case until you begin your deliberations. This rule requires you to keep an open mind until you have heard all of the evidence and is designed to prevent you from influencing how your fellow jurors think until they have heard all of the evidence and had an opportunity to form their own opinions. The time and place for coming to your final opinions and speaking about them with your fellow jurors is during deliberations in the jury room, after all of the evidence has been presented, closing arguments have been made, and I have instructed you on the law. It is important that you hear all of the facts and that you hear the law and how to apply it before you start deciding anything.\n\nConsider Only the Evidence: It is the things you hear and see in this courtroom that matter in this trial. The law tells us that a juror can consider only the testimony and other evidence that all the other jurors have also heard and seen in the presence of the judge and the lawyers. Doing anything else is wrong and is against the law. That means that you must not do any research or investigation, directly or indirectly, about the case. You must not obtain any information about the case or about anyone involved in the case, from any source whatsoever. This includes reading newspapers, watching television, or using a computer, cell phone, the Internet, any electronic device, or any other means at all to get information related to this case or the people and places involved in this case. You must ignore any information about the case you might see, even accidentally, from news media or the Internet or your social media platforms. This is because you must base the decisions you will have to make in this case solely on what you hear and see in this courtroom. This applies whether you are in the courthouse, at home, or anywhere else. You must not visit places mentioned in the trial or use the Internet to look at maps or pictures of any place discussed during trial.\n\nDo not provide any information about this case to anyone, including friends or family members. Do not let anyone, including the closest family members, make comments to you or ask questions about the trial. Jurors must not have discussions of any sort with friends or family members about the case or the people and places involved. So, do not let even the closest family members make comments to you or ask questions about the trial. In this age of electronic communication, I want to stress again that just as you must not talk about this case face-to-face, you must not talk about this case by using an electronic device. You must not use phones, tablets, computers, or other electronic devices to communicate about this case. Do not send or accept any messages related to this case or your jury service. Do not discuss this case or ask for advice by any means at all, including posting on social media, including electronically, or on the Internet through e-mail, text messaging, blogs, or social media such as (insert examples of social media platforms), or any other electronic communication whatsoever.\n\nNo Mid-Trial Discussions: When we are in a recess, do not discuss anything about the trial or the case with each other or with anyone else. If attorneys approach you, don't speak with them. The law says they are to avoid contact with you. If an attorney will not look at you or speak to you, do not be offended or form a conclusion about that behavior. The attorney is not supposed to interact with jurors outside of the courtroom and is only following the rules. The attorney is not being impolite. If an attorney or anyone else does try to speak with you or says something about the case in your presence, please inform the bailiff immediately.\n\nOnly the Jury Decides: Only you get to deliberate and answer the verdict questions at the end of the trial. I will not intrude into your deliberations at all. I am required to be neutral. You should not assume that I prefer one decision over another. You should not try to guess what my opinion is about any part of the case. It would be wrong for you to conclude that anything I say or do means that I am for one side or another in the trial. Discussing and deciding the facts is your job alone.\n\nUse of Cell Phones and Electronic Devices in the Courtroom and Jury Room:*\n\n*The trial judge should select one of the following two alternative instructions explaining the rules governing jurors' use of electronic devices, as explained in Note on Use for 202.3.\n\nAlternative A: [All cell phones or other types of electronic devices must be turned off while you are in the courtroom. Turned off means that the phone or other electronic device is actually off and not in a silent or vibrating mode. You may use these devices during recesses, but even then you may not use your phone or electronic device to find out any information about the case or communicate with anyone about the case or the people involved in the case. Do not take photographs, video recordings or audio recordings of the proceedings or your fellow jurors. After each recess, please double check to make sure your device is turned off. At the end of the case, while you are deliberating, you must not communicate with anyone outside the jury room. You cannot have in the jury room any cell phones, computers, or other electronic devices. If there are breaks in the deliberations, I may allow you to communicate with your family or friends, but do not communicate about the case or your deliberations. If someone needs to contact you in an emergency, the court can receive messages and deliver them to you without delay. The court's phone number will be provided to you.]\n\nAlternative B: [You cannot have any cell phones, computers, or other electronic devices in the courtroom. You may use these devices during recesses, but even then you may not use your phone or electronic device to find out any information about the case or communicate with anyone about the case or the people involved in the case.

Rule 2.451 prohibits jurors from using the cell phones or electronic devices to find out information about the case or to communicate with others about the case. The jurors also cannot use the electronic devices to record, photograph, or videotape the proceedings. In recognition of the discretion rule 2.451 gives trial judges, this instruction provides two alternatives. The trial judge should give the jurors one of the following alternative instructions: (A) requiring jurors to turn off electronic devices during court proceedings and removing their phones and electronic devices during deliberations; or (B) removing the cell phones and electronic devices during all proceedings and deliberations. These instructions may be modified to fit the practices of a trial judge in a particular courtroom. These instructions are not intended to limit the discretion of the trial court to control the proceedings.\n\n4.\tThe portion of this instruction dealing with communication with others and outside research may be modified to include other specified means of communication or research as technology develops.\n\n(Revised December 4, 2014; revised October 27, 2022; revised June 25, 2025.)"

(Plaintiff) has not changed [his][her][its] position in reliance on the contract to such an extent that it would be shockingly unfair to (Plaintiff) to set aside the contract.",
        "notes_on_use": "Rescission on the basis of unilateral mistake is grounded in equity. See Koch v. Pringle Development, Inc., 724 So.2d 655, 656-67 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999) (\"[w]cannot agree with Koch's major premise: that she was entitled to a jury trial on the equitable issue of rescission\").\n\nHowever, breach of contract is a legal claim subject to a jury trial. When unilateral mistake is raised as a defense to a breach of contract claim, it appears to fall within the rule stated in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 510\u201311, 79 S. Ct. 948, 956, 957, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959): \"where both legal and equitable issues are presented in a single case 'only under the most imperative circumstances ... can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims.'\" See also Cerrito v. Kovitch, 457 So.2d 1021, 1022 (Fla. 1984). It therefore appears that the factual issues may be decided by a jury. \"Where a dispute between two parties involves matters of both law and equity, it is within the trial court's discretion to present the 'mixed' issues to a jury for resolution of the factual disputes, or to sever the issues.\" Smith v. Orange Cnty., 497 So. 2d 985, 986 (Fla. 5th DCA 1986).\n\nDePrince v. Starboard Cruise Services, Inc., 271 So.3d 11 (Fla. 3d DCA 2018) (on rehearing en banc) is the only reported Florida case in which the issue of unilateral mistake was submitted to a jury. The Committee notes that whether the defense was properly submitted to the jury was not an issue on appeal in DePrince.\n\nThis instruction provides a framework for the jury to decide the factual issues related to the elements of the defense. Whether the jury would decide whether the contract in fact \"should be set aside,\" or whether the judge would have discretion to allow the jury to make only the findings of fact, reserving the ultimate equitable decision for the judge, is not resolved by this proposed instruction. Pending further developments in the law regarding what issues should be decided by the jury, the Committee does not propose a model verdict form for this defense.\n\nThe opinion in DePrince, when explaining this affirmative defense, uses the word \"unconscionable\" when discussing the element of the Plaintiff's reliance. This instruction uses the phrase \"shockingly unfair\" instead of \"unconscionable.\" The Committee has chosen to use plain language rather than a legal term that might confuse the jury. Black's Law Dictionary (11th Ed. 2019) defines \"unconscionable\" as \"shockingly unjust or unfair.\"\n\nDePrince explains that inducement is not an element of this defense. Id. at 20. It then explains that a contract may be set aside if three elements are established. The second element is a showing that \"denial of release from the contract would be inequitable.\" The Committee believes that under the holding in Maryland Casualty Co. v. Krasnek, 174 So. 2d 541 (Fla. 1965), this element is established by a showing of a material mistake made by the Defendant when the mistake was not the result of an inexcusable lack of due care. Because this instruction already explains that those elements must be established, the instruction does not contain an additional element that the denial of the release from the contract would be inequitable."

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tInstruction 401.12a (legal cause generally) is to be given in all cases. Instruction 401.12b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether negligence was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his or her negligence by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 401.12c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tThe jury will properly consider instruction 401.12a not only in determining whether defendant's negligence is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's negligence contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3.\tInstruction 401.12b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries/multiple events, instructions 501.5a or 501.5b should be given as well. See Hart v. Stern, 824 So. 2d 927, 929\u201332 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002); Marinelli v. Grace, 608 So. 2d 833, 834\u201335 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).\n\n4.\tInstruction 401.12c (intervening cause) embraces two situations in which negligence may be a legal cause notwithstanding the influence of an intervening cause: (1) when the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the negligence although the other cause was not foreseeable, Mozer v. Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Gibson v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., 386 So. 2d 520 (Fla. 1980).\n\n5. \t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be instructed that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the negligence. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts 291 (3d ed.); 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts, 1137.\n\n6.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the instruction to describe the extent of contribution or influence negligence must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937).\n\n(Revised June 19, 2024.)"

(Defendant) promised to [describe subject matter of alleged promise];\n\n2. (Defendant) should have expected the promise to change (claimant)'s behavior;\n\n3. In reliance on (defendant)'s promise, (claimant) changed [his] [her] [its] behavior; and\n\n4. Injustice can be avoided only if the promise is enforced.\n\nTo \"change behavior\" means to do something of significance that the person otherwise would not have done, or to refrain from doing something of significance that the person otherwise would have done.\n\nA claim of this kind must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, not just by the greater weight of the evidence. Your verdict will be for (claimant) on this claim only if you find by clear and convincing evidence each of the elements that I just described to you.",
        "notes_on_use": "1. The definition of the clear and convincing evidence standard is set forth in Standard Jury Instruction\u2014Civil 405.4.\n\n2. No Florida court has directly decided the issue of whether the court or a jury should decide the issues related to a promissory estoppel claim; however, there are several Florida appellate decisions that have indicated that it is appropriate to submit such a claim to a jury. See, e.g., Sunshine Bottling Co. v. Tropicana Prods. Inc., 757 So. 2d 1231, 1232 (Fla. 3d DCA 2000) (concluding that trial court erred in entering a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and reversing and remanding for reinstatement of the jury's award on the promissory estoppel claim); W.R. Townsend Contracting, Inc. v. Jensen Civil Constr., Inc., 728 So. 2d 297, 306 (Fla. 1st DCA 1999) (reversing order dismissing promissory estoppel claim and remanding with instructions for a jury trial)."

Appliances of Naples, Inc., 563 So. 2d 767, 770 (Fla. 2d DCA 1990) (citing Crown Ice Machine Leasing Co. v. Sam Senter Farms, Inc., 174 So. 2d 614, 617 (Fla. 2d DCA 1965)). See also, In re Cinemex USA Real Estate Holdings, Inc., 627 B.R. 693, 697 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2021).\n\nThe defense of frustration of purpose is grounded in equity. See generally Cinemex, 627 B.R. at 701 n.17. However, breach of contract is a legal claim subject to a jury trial. When frustration of purpose is raised as a defense to a breach of contract claim, it appears to fall within the rule stated in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 510\u201311, 79 S. Ct. 948, 956, 957, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959): \"where both legal and equitable issues are presented in a single case 'only under the most imperative circumstances . . . can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims.'\" See also Cerrito v. Kovitch, 457 So.2d 1021, 1022 (Fla. 1984). It therefore appears that the factual issues may be decided by a jury. \"Where a dispute between two parties involves matters of both law and equity, it is within the trial court's discretion to present the 'mixed' issues to a jury for resolution of the factual disputes, or to sever the issues.\" Smith v. Orange Cnty., 497 So. 2d 985, 986 (Fla. 5th DCA 1986). This instruction provides a framework for the jury to decide the factual issues related to the elements of the defense. Whether the jury would decide if the defense applies, or whether the judge would have discretion to allow the jury to make only the findings of fact, reserving the ultimate equitable decision for the judge, is not resolved by this instruction. See Cinemex, 627 B.R. at 701. Pending further developments in the law regarding what issues should be decided by the jury, the Committee provides no model verdict form for this defense.\n\n(Adopted June 25, 2025)"

That issue is:\n\na.\tOwner, lessee, or bailee of vehicle driven by another:\n\nwhether (defendant) was the [owner] [lessee] [or] [bailee] of the vehicle driven by (driver) [or] whether (driver) was operating the vehicle with the express or implied consent of (defendant). A person who [owns] [is the lessee of] [or] [is the bailee of] a vehicle and who expressly or impliedly consents to another's use of it is responsible for its operation.\n\n[An owner of a vehicle is one who has legal title to the vehicle and who has the right of control and authority over its use.]\n\n[A lessee of a vehicle is one who has leased or rented the vehicle from its owner.]\n\n[A bailee of a vehicle is one to whom the vehicle has been furnished or delivered by [its owner] [a person with authority over its use] for a particular purpose, with the understanding that it will be returned.]\n\nb.\tAgency.\n\n(1).\tAgency, master and servant (independent contractor distinguished):\n\nwhether (name) was an agent of (defendant) and was acting within the scope of [his] [her] employment at the time and place of the incident in this case. [An agent is a person who is employed to act for another, and whose actions are controlled by [his] [her] employer or are subject to [his] [her] employer's right of control.] An employer is responsible for the negligence of [his] [her] [its] agent if such negligence occurs while the agent is performing services which [he] [she] was employed to perform or while the agent is acting at least in part because of a desire to serve [his] [her] employer and is doing something that is reasonably incidental to [his] [her] employment or something the doing of which was reasonably foreseeable and reasonably to be expected of persons similarly employed.\n\n[But a person is not responsible for the negligence of an independent contractor or of the agents or employees of an independent contractor. An independent contractor is a [person] [business] who is engaged by another to perform specific work according to [his] [her] [its] own methods and whose methods of performing the work are not controlled by the person engaging [him] [her] [it] and are not subject to that person's right of control.]\n\n(2).\tApparent agency:\n\nwhether (name) was an apparent agent of (defendant) and was acting within the scope of [his] [her] apparent authority at the time and place of the incident in this case. [An agent is a person who is employed to act for another, and whose actions are controlled by [his] [her] employer or [is] [are] subject to [his] [her] employer's right of control.] (Name) was an apparent agent if (defendant) by [his] [her] [its] words or conduct caused or allowed (claimant) to believe that (name) was an agent of and had authority to act for (defendant) and if (claimant) justifiably relied upon that belief in dealing with (name) as the agent of (defendant). A person is responsible for the negligence of [his] [her] [its] apparent agent occurring while the apparent agent is acting within the scope of [his] [her] apparent authority.\n\nc.\tUltrahazardous work (exception to nonliability for negligence of independent contractor):\n\nwhether (defendant) [authorized or permitted another to carry on] [or] [knowingly assisted or participated in carrying on], upon premises owned or possessed by [him] [her], an activity which (defendant) knew or should have known was ultrahazardous. The performance of work is ultrahazardous if there is a real and substantial danger inherent in the work itself and if the work is of such a nature that, in the ordinary course of events, performance of the work will probably cause injury if proper precautions are not taken. A person who [authorizes or permits another to carry on] [or] [knowingly assists or participates in carrying on] ultra-hazardous work on premises owned or possessed by the employer is responsible for negligence in the performance of the work by the other or by his or her agents and employees.\n\nd.\tPartnership:\n\nwhether (name) was a partner of (defendant) and was acting on behalf of the partnership and within the scope of its business at the time and place of the incident in this case. A partnership exists when two or more persons join together or agree to join together in a business or venture for their common benefit, each contributing property, money or services and each having an interest in any profits. Each member of a partnership is responsible for the negligence of any partner if such negligence occurs while the partner is acting on behalf of the partnership and within the scope of the partnership's business.\n\ne.\tJoint venture:\n\nwhether at the time and place of the incident complained of, (name) was engaged in a joint venture with (defendant) and was acting on behalf of the joint venture and within the scope of its business at the time and place of the incident in this case. A joint venture exists when two or more persons combine their resources or efforts and agree to undertake some particular business transaction in which they have common interests in the purposes to be accomplished, joint control or right of control of the venture, joint ownership interest in the subject matter of the venture and a common right and duty to share in profits and losses. Each member of a joint venture is responsible for the negligence of another member if such other member's negligence occurs while he or she is acting on behalf of the joint venture and within the scope of its business.\n\nf.\tJoint enterprise (automobile):\n\nwhether (driver) was operating the automobile at the time and place of the [collision] [incident complained of] to further the purposes of a joint enterprise in which [he] [she] was engaged with (defendant passenger). A joint enterprise exists when two or more persons agree, expressly or impliedly, to engage in an activity in which they have a common interest in the purposes to be accomplished and equal rights to control and manage the operation of an automobile in the enterprise. Each member of a joint enterprise is responsible for the negligence of another member in the operation of the automobile if that negligence occurs while he or she is acting under the agreement and to further the purposes of the joint enterprise.",
        "notes_on_use": "NOTES ON USE FOR 401.14a\n\n1.\tThe general rules stated above will be appropriate in most cases in which there is an issue concerning the status of a defendant under Florida's \"dangerous instrumentality\" doctrine. See generally Aurbach v. Gallina, 753 So. 2d 60 (Fla. 2000). They are subject to a number of exceptions, however. For example, the owner of a vehicle who has delivered possession of it to another under a conditional sales contract, and who has complied with all the requirements of F.S. 319.22, is not liable for its negligent operation. See Aurbach; Palmer v. R. S. Evans, Jacksonville, Inc., 81 So. 2d 635 (Fla. 1955). The owner of a vehicle who has leased it to another under a lease for one year or longer and who has complied with all the requirements of F.S. 324.021(9)(b)1, is not liable for its negligent operation. See Ady v. American Honda Finance Corp., 675 So. 2d 577 (Fla. 1996). Additional limitations upon vicarious liability are set forth in F.S. 324.021(9)(b) and 324.021(9)(c). An owner or lessee who has delivered a vehicle to a repair shop for maintenance is ordinarily not liable for its negligent operation during servicing, service-related testing, or transport of the vehicle by the bailee. See Michalek v. Shumate, 524 So. 2d 426 (Fla. 1988); Castillo v. Bickley, 363 So. 2d 792 (Fla. 1978). Although an owner is liable for a personal injury or wrongful death negligently inflicted by a bailee upon a third party, an owner is not liable for a personal injury or wrongful death negligently inflicted by a bailee upon a co-bailee. See Toombs v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., 833 So. 2d 109 (Fla. 2002); Raydel, Ltd. v. Medcalfe, 178 So. 2d 569 (Fla. 1965); May v. Palm Beach Chemical Co., 77 So. 2d 468 (Fla. 1955). And proof of express or implied consent is not required where an unattended vehicle has been stolen because the owner left the keys in the ignition. See Hendeles v. Sanford Auto Auction, Inc., 364 So. 2d 467 (Fla. 1978); Vining v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., 354 So. 2d 54 (Fla. 1977). Other exceptions may exist for which special instructions may be required. See generally 4A FLA.JUR.2d, Automobiles and Other Vehicles, \u00a7\u00a7667\u2013690. The instruction may also have to be tailored to fit the particular factual circumstances of the case.\n\n2.\tDangerous instrumentality. The committee recommends that the court not instruct the jury that an automobile is a \"dangerous instrumentality,\" such an instruction being unnecessary and essentially argumentative.\n\nNOTE ON USE FOR 401.14b(1)\n\n1.\tFor purposes of defining liability for negligence, there is no reason to distinguish between the relationship of principal and agent and the relationship of master and servant. See Lynch v. Walker, 31 So. 2d 268 (Fla. 1947).\n\n2.\tFor judicial opinions relating to an agency instruction in the context of a franchise relationship, see Domino's Pizza, LLC v. Wiederhold, 306 So. 3d 384 (Fla. 5th DCA 2020) and Ross v. Elaine Powers Figure Salon, 289 So. 2d 70 (Fla. 4th DCA 1974).\n\nNOTES ON USE FOR 401.14b(1) AND (2)\n\n1.\tIf the court determines that issues on both actual agency and apparent agency should be submitted to the jury, give both instructions 401.14b(1) and b(2), omitting the bracketed language in b(2). When instruction 401.14b(2) is used alone, give the bracketed language.\n\n2.\tFor the rules which might be applicable if the independent contractor is engaged in inherently dangerous work or using a dangerous instrumentality, see Florida Power & Light Co. v. Price, 170 So. 2d 293 (Fla. 1964).\n\nNOTE ON USE FOR 401.14c\n\nPrice v. Florida Power & Light Co., 159 So. 2d 654 (Fla. 2d DCA 1963), rev'd 170 So. 2d 293. If the activity in question is ultrahazardous as a matter of law, this instruction should be omitted and instruction 401.13b, the preemptive instruction on vicarious liability, should be given.\n\nNOTE ON USE FOR 401.14\n\nInstruction 401.14 should be followed by instruction 401.17, Burden of Proof on Preliminary Issues, unless there are other preliminary issues, in which case instruction 401.17 would follow all preliminary issue instructions.\n\n(Amended July 28, 2022.)"

The committee recommends that no instruction be given to the effect that one is presumed to have exercised reasonable care for one's own safety or for the safety of others or that one has the right to assume others will exercise reasonable care.

The committee recommends that no instruction be given on the following subjects: (a) duty to keep lookout; (b) duty to inspect vehicle or to maintain vehicle in safe condition; or (c) the supposed \"range of vision\" rule. Negligence is properly and completely defined as the failure to use that degree of care which a reasonable person would use under like circumstances.\n\n6.\tRailroads. The committee recommends that no instruction be given on the following subjects: (a) the supposed duty of a pedestrian or motorist to \"yield the right of way\" to an approaching train; (b) reciprocal duties at railroad crossings; or (c) the \"standing train\" doctrine.

When the legislative authority enacts such a statute or ordinance, it thereby prescribes a minimum standard of reasonable care to which every reasonably careful person will adhere. The jury is not at liberty to determine that the violation of such a standard is not negligence. Richardson v. Fountain, 154 So. 2d 709 (Fla. 2d DCA 1963), and cases cited at 154 So. 2d at 711; 38 Am.Jur. Negligence \u00a7158, at 827\u201329; but compare Mastrandrea v. J. Mann, Inc., 128 So. 2d 146 (Fla. 3d DCA 1963).\n\n2.\tThis instruction should not be used in \"strict liability\" cases in which liability is predicated on violation of a statute enacted to protect a particular class of persons who are unable to protect themselves. In such cases, the violator is strictly liable for the consequent injury, even though the violation was not the \"proximate\" or \"legal\" cause by traditional tests. Sloan v. Coit International, Inc., 292 So. 2d 15 (Fla. 1974); Tamiami Gun Shop v. Klein, 109 So. 2d 189 (Fla. 3d DCA 1959), cert. disch. 116 So. 2d 421; see deJesus."

Branham, 99 So. 2d 621 (Fla. 3d DCA 1958).\n\n2.\tIn the case of a person having an express or implied invitation, use instruction 401.16a instead of instruction 401.16b. As a result of Wood v. Camp, 284 So. 2d 691 (Fla. 1973), the former licensee category now consists only of \"uninvited licensees.\"\n\nNOTES ON USE FOR 401.16c\n\n1.\tDerived from Restatement (2d) of Torts \u00a7339; Cockerham v. Vaughan, Inc., 82 So. 2d 890 (Fla. 1955); Banks v. Mason, 132 So. 2d 219 (Fla. 2d DCA 1961); Fouraker v. Mullis, 120 So. 2d 808 (Fla. 1st DCA 1960). Considered together, instructions 401.16c and 401.20c cover all elements of the attractive nuisance doctrine. Since plaintiff must, in effect, negate negligence in order to prevail on this doctrine, comparative negligence is not a defense. Larnel Builders, Inc. v. Martin, 110 So. 2d 649 (Fla. 1959).\n\n2.\tCaselaw also uses the phrases \"enticed\" and \"allured\" instead of, or in addition to, \"attracted\". See, e.g., Concrete Const., Inc., of Lake Worth v. Petterson, 216 So. 2d 221, 223 (Fla. 1968); Martinello v. B & P USA, Inc., 566 So. 2d 761 (Fla. 1990). This instruction uses \"attracted\" because it is more likely to be understood by the average juror; however, \"enticed\" or \"allured\" may be used instead of, or in addition to, \"attracted\" if the facts warrant.\n\n3.\tThe Committee takes no position as to whether the claimant must have been attracted or lured onto the premises by its general condition or by the condition that ultimately caused the claimant's harm. See, e.g., Stark v. Holtzclaw, 105 So. 330 (Fla. 1925); Martinello v. B & P USA, Inc., 556 So. 2d 761 (Fla. 1990); Mueller v. South Fla. Water Mgmt.

Saha, 451 So. 2d 516 (Fla. 5th DCA 1984).\n\nNOTES ON USE FOR 401.16\n\n1.\tInstruction 401.16 should be used when the jury could reasonably decide either for claimant or for defendant on the issue of whether defendant owed claimant the degree of care that is an essential part of the claim made by claimant, e.g., as when claimant contends he was an invitee on the defendant's premises and defendant contends that plaintiff was a trespasser.\n\n2.\tInstruction 401.16 is intended to frame the issues determining claimant's status or defendant's duty. It is not intended as a statement of the degree of care owed. The matter of degree of care is covered in the instructions on negligence issues.\n\n3.\tThe variations of instruction 401.16 state affirmatively the circumstances that must be shown in order for claimant to prevail on this particular issue. If these circumstances are not shown by the greater weight of the evidence, claimant cannot prevail on a claim that depends on such a showing.\n\n4.\tInstruction 401.16 should be followed by instruction 401.17, Burden of Proof on Preliminary Issues."

The committee considers subsections (d) and (e) of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7339 to be unnecessary to the instruction because negligence is otherwise defined by instruction 401.4.\n\nNOTES ON USE FOR 401.20d\n\n1.\tThis instruction, reflecting a greater duty by landlord to tenant on leased residential premises, was derived from Mansur v. Eubanks, 401 So. 2d 1328 (Fla. 1981), overruling to that extent Brooks v. Peters, 25 So. 2d 205 (Fla. 1946). See also F.S. 83.51 (1981), which may impose on the landlord greater duties, in respect to conditions arising after a tenant's possession, than were addressed in Mansur. If other or greater duties are imposed by the statute, this instruction should be modified to express those duties in the terms of the case. This instruction pertains to the landlord's duties, not the tenant's, but the committee calls attention to statutes in F.S. Chapter 83 imposing certain duties on the tenant, which may affect the landlord's duties as expressed in this instruction.\n\n2.\tCommon areas. In the absence of an agreement otherwise, a landlord's duty in common areas when the leased premises are residential is set forth in F.S. 83.51(2)(a)3. Fieldhouse v. Tam Inv. Co., 959 So. 2d 1214 (Fla. 4th DCA 2007); Haynes v. Lloyd, 533 So. 2d 944 (Fla. 5th DCA 1988).\n\n3.\tPersons invited on leased residential premises by tenant. The landlord's duty to persons invited on leased residential premises by the tenant is the same as the landlord's duty to the tenant. Mansur v. Eubanks, 401 So. 2d 1328 (Fla. 1981).\n\n4.\tWaiver. The committee expresses no opinion about whether a tenant may waive duties owed him by the landlord. Compare Mansur v. Eubanks, 401 So. 2d 1328 (Fla. 1981), with F.S. 83.51(1)(b), 83.51(4), and 83.47 (1981).\n\nNOTE ON USE FOR 401.20e\n\n1.\tCity of Tampa v. Johnson, 114 So. 2d 807 (Fla. 2d DCA 1959); Schutzer v. City of Miami, 105 So. 2d 492 (Fla. 3d DCA 1958).\n\n2.\tThe final segment of instruction 401.20e, marked with an asterisk (*), is inapplicable when plaintiff does not proceed on a theory of defendant's failure to warn.\n\nNOTE ON USE FOR 401.20f\n\nIf the owner or principal operator of a multifamily residential property substantially implements the security measures listed in F.S. 768.0706(2)(a), F.S. 768.0706 provides for a rebuttable presumption against liability in connection with criminal acts that occur on the premises that are committed by third parties who are not employees or agents of the owner or operator. See F.S. 90.301\u201390.304. The committee offers no standard instruction on this presumption pending further development in the law."

        "notes_on_use": "NOTES ON USE FOR 401.22a\n\n1.\tInstruction 401.4, defining negligence, is applicable both to defendant's negligence and claimant's negligence. The consequences of negligence on claimant's part are explained to the jury by instruction 401.22a. There being no need to give claimant's negligence the special designation \"comparative negligence,\" the committee recommends that \"comparative negligence\" not be referred to in the instruction and that the term not be defined.\n\n2.\tSpecial verdicts and special interrogatories. Special verdicts are required in all jury trials involving comparative negligence. Lawrence v. Florida East Coast Railway Co., 346 So. 2d 1012 (Fla. 1977).\n\n3.\tPresumption of reasonable care. The committee recommends that no instruction be given to the effect that a deceased person or an injured person or either party is presumed to have exercised reasonable care for his own safety or for the safety of others. If such a presumption is thought to take the place of evidence and make a prima facie case for the party having the burden of proof, the presumption \"disappears\" upon the introduction of any evidence tending to overcome it. Gulle v. Boggs, 174 So. 2d 26 (Fla. 1965). If the presumption is thought to operate against the party having the burden of proof, as in the case of the presumption that a decedent was not comparatively negligent but was exercising reasonable care for his own safety, such an instruction is merely a way (and a confusing way, at that) of stating that the burden of proving comparative negligence is on the party asserting it. In either case, an instruction on the subject is superfluous. But compare Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Yniestra, 21 Fla. 700 (1886); Jacksonville Electric Co. v. Sloan, 52 Fla. 257, 42 So. 516 (Fla. 1906); and Martin v. Makris, 101 So. 2d 172 (Fla. 3d DCA 1958).\n\nNOTE ON USE FOR 401.22e\n\nWynne v. Adside, 163 So. 2d 760 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964). See also Winner v. Sharp, 43 So. 2d 634 (Fla. 1950).\n\nNOTES ON USE FOR 401.22f\n\n1.\tSee F.S. 768.81 (2019); Fabre v. Marin, 623 So. 2d 1182 (Fla. 1993). In most cases, use of the term \"negligence\" will be appropriate. If another type of fault is at issue, it may be necessary to modify the instruction and the verdict form accordingly.\n\n2.\tFor fault to be apportioned among multiple tortfeasors, the tortfeasors must be joint tortfeasors. See Grobman v. Posey, 863 So. 2d 1230, 1234 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003). Joint tortfeasors are those \"who act together in committing wrong, or whose acts if independent of each other, unite in causing single injury.\" Letzter v. Cephas, 792 So. 2d 481, 486 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001) (internal quotations omitted). For discussions as to whether apportionment is appropriate, see, e.g., Specialty Hosp.-Gainesville, Inc. v. Barth, 277 So. 3d 201, 215 (Fla. 1st DCA 2019) (apportionment is not appropriate where the defendant and the third part are successive tortfeasors); Grobman, 863 So. 2d at 1236 (apportionment is not appropriate where liability between the defendant and the third party is derivative); Suarez v. Gonzalez, 820 So. 2d 342, 344 (Fla. 4th DCA 2002) (apportionment is not appropriate between a defendant and a third party where the defendant hired the third party to perform a nondelegable duty).\n\nNOTE ON USE FOR 401.22g\n\nBlackburn v. Dorta, 348 So. 2d 287 (Fla. 1977), abolished the assumption of risk defense except in cases identified in that opinion."

Instruction 402.6b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether negligence was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his negligence by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 402.6c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tThe jury will properly consider instruction 402.6a not only in determining whether defendant's negligence is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's negligence contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3.\tInstruction 402.6b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or in part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries or multiple events, instruction 501.5a or 501.5b should be given as well. See Hart v.

Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) where the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Ellingson v. Willis, 170 So. 2d 311 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964).\n\n5.\t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be charged that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the negligence. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts (3d ed.) 291; 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts 1137.\n\n6.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the charge to describe the extent of contribution or influence negligence must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 129 Fla. 355, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937)."

        "main_paragraph": "On (claimant's) claim there is a preliminary issue for you to decide. That issue is:\n\na.\tAgency:\n\n(1).\tEmployment, including independent contractor and exceptions:\n\nwhether (name) was an employee of (defendant) and was acting within the scope of [his] [her] employment at the time and place of the incident in this case. An employee is a person who is hired by (defendant) to act on behalf of (defendant), and whose actions are controlled by (defendant) or are subject to (defendant's) right of control. An employer is responsible for the negligence of an employee if the negligence occurs while the employee is performing services which [he] [she] was employed to perform or while the employee is acting at least in part because of a desire to serve [his] [her] employer and is doing something that is reasonably incidental to [his] [her] employment or something the doing of which was reasonably foreseeable and reasonably to be expected of persons similarly employed.\n\n[But a person is not responsible for the negligence of an independent contractor or of the agents or employees of an independent contractor. An independent contractor is a [person] [business] engaged by another to perform specific work according to [his] [her] [its] own methods and whose methods of performing the work are not controlled by the person engaging [him] [her] [it] and are not subject to that person's right of control. Whether a [person] [business] is an independent contractor is to be determined on the basis of all of the circumstances of the parties' dealings with each other and not on the basis of the labels used by them.\n\nA person is, however, responsible for the negligence of an independent contractor if [the independent contractor is an [actual] [or] [apparent] agent of that person], [the employer did not exercise due care in the [selection] [or] [retention] of the independent contractor] [or] [the employer undertook to perform the services resulting in the injury to (claimant).]*\n\n[(Name) is an agent if (defendant) authorized [him] [her] to act on (defendant's) behalf.] [(Name) is an apparent agent if, by words or conduct, (defendant) caused or allowed (claimant) to believe that (name) was an agent of and had authority to act for (defendant).] A person is responsible for the negligence of [his] [her] independent contractor if, at the time and place of the incident, the independent contractor was an [agent] [or] [apparent agent] of the employer and was acting within the scope of his or her [apparent] authority.*\n\n[In [hiring] [or] [retaining] another to perform services, the employer must exercise due care to assure that the person is competent to perform the services. A person is responsible for the negligence of [his] [her] independent contractor if, in [hiring] [or] [retaining] the independent contractor, the employer failed to exercise due care.]\n\n[When a [person] [facility] undertakes to perform services, [he] [she] [it] cannot transfer the obligation to perform those services to an independent contractor and remains responsible for the negligence of [his] [her] independent contractor.]\n\n(2).\tAgency without claim of independent contractor:\n\nwhether (name) is an agent of (defendant). [(Name) is an agent of (defendant) if (defendant) authorized [him] [her][it] to act on (defendant's) behalf.] [(Name) is an apparent agent if, by words or conduct, (defendant) caused or allowed (claimant) to believe that (name) was an agent of and had authority to act for (defendant).] A person is responsible for the negligence of an [agent] [or] [apparent agent] if at the time and place of the incident complained of the [agent] [or] [apparent agent] is acting within the scope of [his] [her] [apparent] authority.\n\nb.\tJoint venture:\n\nwhether at the time and place of the incident complained of, (name) was engaged in a joint venture with (defendant) and was acting on behalf of the joint venture and within the scope of its business at the time and place of the incident in this case. A joint venture exists when two or more persons combine their resources or efforts and agree to undertake some particular business transaction in which they have common interests in the purposes to be accomplished, joint control or right of control of the venture, joint ownership interest in the subject matter of the venture and a common right and duty to share in profits and losses. Each member of a joint venture is responsible for the negligence of another member if the other member's negligence occurs while [he] [she] is acting on behalf of the joint venture and to further the purpose of the joint venture.",
        "notes_on_use": "NOTES ON USE FOR 402.9a(1)\n\n1.\tThe bracketed language contained in the second and third paragraphs is only to be used when there is a claim of independent contractor status. See Carlisle v. Carnival Corp., 864 So. 2d 1 (Fla. 3d DCA 2003); Villazon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 843 So. 2d 842 (Fla. 2003). If an exception to independent contractor status is claimed, then the applicable portions of the fourth paragraph should also be given.\n\n2.\tBoth bracketed sections of the fourth paragraph should be used with appropriate transitional language if the court determines that issues on both actual agency and apparent agency should be submitted to the jury.\n\n3.\tAs to the fifth paragraph regarding due care when hiring another, see Insigna v.

Doctors Hospital of Lake Worth, Inc., 415 So. 2d 55, 57\u201360 n.2 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982), a case concerning an implied contractual nondelegable duty. In addition to implied contracts, nondelegable duties arise out of other legal obligations\u2014for example, express contracts, the common law, statutes, and regulations. See, e.g., Pope v. Winter Park Healthcare Group, Ltd., 939 So. 2d 185, 188 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006). One court has noted the lack of any \"specific criteria for determining whether or not a duty is nondelegable except for the rather ambiguous defining characteristic that the responsibility is so important to the community that the employer should not be allowed to transfer it to a third party.\" Dixon v. Whitfield, 654 So. 2d 1230, 1232 (Fla. 1st DCA 1995). Courts have determined the existence or nonexistence of a nondelegable duty in pretrial rulings as a matter of law. See, e.g., Wax v. Tenet Health Sys. Hosps., Inc., 955 So. 2d 1, 6 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006). Because disagreements on nondelegable duties exist among the courts\u2014see, e.g., Tabraue v. Doctors Hosp., Inc., 272 So. 3d 468, 474\u201375 (Fla. 3d DCA 2019) (certifying conflict with Wax, Irving, and one other case)\u2014the committee takes no position on whether the instruction is appropriate in every case, or any particular case.\n\nNOTE ON USE FOR 402.9a(2)\n\nRoessler v.

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tInstruction 403.12a (legal cause generally) is to be given in all cases. Instruction 403.12b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether negligence was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his or her negligence by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 403.12c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tThe jury will properly consider instruction 403.12a not only in determining whether defendant's negligence is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's negligence contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3.\tInstruction 403.12b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries or multiple events, instruction 501.2h(1) or (2) should be given as well. See Hart v. Stern, 824 So. 2d 927, 929\u201332 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002); Marinelli v. Grace, 608 So. 2d 833, 834\u201335 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).\n\n4.\tInstruction 403.12c (intervening cause) embraces two situations in which negligence may be a legal cause notwithstanding the influence of an intervening cause: (1) where the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the negligence although the other cause was not foreseeable, Mozer v. Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965); and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Gibson v. Avis Rent-A-Car System Inc., 386 So. 2d 520 (Fla. 1980).\n\n5.\t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be charged that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the negligence. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts (3d ed.) 291; 2 Harper and James, The Law of Torts 1137.\n\n6.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the instruction to describe the extent of contribution or influence negligence must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's contributory negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 129 Fla. 355, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937).\n\n(Adopted March 26, 2015, revised December 4, 2024.)"

If it is necessary to submit a factual issue on privity to the jury, the committee recommends that it be submitted in the style of a preliminary charge on status or duty.

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tComparative negligence is a defense to strict liability claims if based on grounds other than the failure of the user to discover the defect or to guard against the possibility of its existence. West v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 336 So. 2d 80, 90 (Fla. 1976).\n\n2.\tThe \"patent danger doctrine\" is not an independent defense but, to the extent applicable (see note 1), it is subsumed in the defense of comparative negligence. Auburn Machine Works Inc. v. Jones, 366 So. 2d 1167 (Fla. 1979).\n\n3.\tApportionment of fault. See F.S. 768.81 (2020) Fabre v. Marin, 623 So. 2d 1182 (Fla. 1993). In most cases, use of the term \"negligence\" will be appropriate. If another type of fault is at issue, it may be necessary to modify the instruction and the verdict form accordingly. In strict liability cases, the term \"responsibility\" may be the most appropriate descriptive term.\n\nFor fault to be apportioned among multiple tortfeasors, the tortfeasors must be joint tortfeasors. See Grobman v. Posey, 863 So. 2d 1230, 1234(Fla. 4th DCA 2003). \"Joint tortfeasors are defined as those who in committing wrong, or whose acts if independent of each other, unite in causing single injury.\" Letzter v.

Apportionment of fault does not apply to \"to any action based upon an intentional tort...\" \u00a7 768.81, Fla. Stat. (2020).\n\n4.\tLearned intermediary defense. See Aubin v. Union Carbide Corp., 177 So. 3d 489, 515\u201316 (Fla. 2015). The list of factors set forth in this instruction is not exclusive and may be modified to fit the facts of the case.\n\n5.\tGovernment Rules Defense.

The statute does not state whether the presumption is a burden-shifting or a vanishing presumption. See F.S. 90.301\u201390.304; Universal Insurance Co. of North America v.

If a preemptive instruction for claimant is appropriate on a defense issue, as when comparative negligence or assumption of risk has been brought to the jury's attention on voir dire or by opening statements or argument and is now to be withdrawn, an instruction in the form of instruction 401.13 should be given immediately following instruction 403.15. If a preemptive instruction for defendant is required on some aspect of a defense, as when, for example, the court holds that any comparative negligence of the driver will reduce claimant's recovery, a preemptive instruction announcing the ruling should be given immediately after framing the defense issues (instruction 403.18).\n\n2.\tIn most cases, use of the term \"negligence\" will be appropriate.

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tInstruction 404.6a (legal cause generally) is to be given in all cases in which the issue of damages is submitted to the jury. No part of this instruction should be given if the court is going to determine damages (see instruction 404.9). Instruction 404.6b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether bad faith conduct was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his or her bad faith conduct by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 404.6c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tInstruction 404.6b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries/multiple events, instruction 501.5a or 501.5b should be given as well. See Hart v. Stern, 824 So. 2d 927, 929\u201332 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002); Marinelli v. Grace, 608 So. 2d 833, 834\u201335 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).\n\n3.\tInstruction 404.6c (intervening cause) embraces two situations in which bad faith conduct may be a legal cause notwithstanding the influence of an intervening cause: (1) when the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the bad faith conduct although the other cause was not foreseeable, Mozer v. Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Gibson v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., 386 So. 2d 520 (Fla. 1980).\n\n4.\t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be instructed that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the bad faith conduct. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts 291 (3d ed.); 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts 1137.\n\n5.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the instruction to describe the extent of contribution or influence bad faith conduct must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937)."

If so, then the jury need not be instructed on that particular element. For these reasons, the committee has placed each of the four elements in brackets.\n\n3.\tThis instruction, by itself, may not be sufficient when the defense of competition is tried. Specifically, the trial court may need to instruct the jury further on the meaning of the elements of the defense. For example, the jury may need to be instructed on what is and is not an \"improper\" means; the court may want to consult the non-exhaustive list of improper means (physical violence, misrepresentations, illegal conduct, and threats of illegal conduct) found in instruction 408.6. As another example, the court may need to consult authorities outside of these instructions to fashion a proper jury instruction on what is and is not an \"unlawful restraint on trade.\"\n\n(Adopted February 17, 2022.)"

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tInstruction 411.4a (legal cause generally) is to be given in all cases. Instruction 411.4b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether conduct was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his conduct by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 411.4c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tThe jury will properly consider instruction 411.4a not only in determining whether defendant's conduct is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's conduct contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3. \tInstruction 411.4b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries/multiple events, instruction 501.5a or b should be given as well. See Hart v. Stern, 824 So. 2d 927, 929\u201332 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002); Marinelli v. Grace, 608 So. 2d 833, 834\u201335 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).\n\n4.\tInstruction 411.4c (intervening cause) embraces two situations in which conduct may be a legal cause notwithstanding the influence of an intervening cause: (1) when the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conduct although the other cause was not foreseeable, Mozer v. Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Gibson v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., 386 So. 2d 520 (Fla. 1980).\n\n5.\t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be instructed that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the outrageous conduct. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts 291 (3d ed.); 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts 1137.\n\n6.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the instruction to describe the extent of contribution or influence outrageous conduct must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937).\n\n(Revised December 4, 2024.)"

Navarro, 665 So. 2d 340, 341 (Fla. 4th DCA 1995). If claimant seeks to avoid the effect of a warrant or court order for his arrest, the issue will ordinarily be one of law, but if a jury question arises, an appropriate instruction should be given allocating the burden of proof to claimant.\n\n3.\tArrest without warrant or court order. The burden of pleading and proving probable cause or other justification for restraint made without warrant or court order is on defendant. Rivers v. Dillard's Dept.

A person interferes with a contract between two [or more] other persons if he or she induces or otherwise causes one of them to breach or refuse to perform the contract.

If there are factual disputes as to the existence or the non-terminable nature of a contract, an instruction submitting those preliminary issues must precede instruction 408.5 and it should be modeled on instruction 416.1 et seq. of the Standard Jury Instructions in Contract & Business Cases. If one or more of these preliminary issues has been tried but the court determines it as a matter of law, the court should give a preemptive instruction. An example of a preemptive charge can be found at instruction 401.13.\n\n2.\tInstruction 408.5 applies to cases where the issue to be determined is whether the defendant has intentionally interfered with a contract not terminable at will. In most such cases, there is no \"justification\" or \"privilege.\" Therefore, if the interference is \"intentional,\" it is likewise \"improper.\" However, in certain relatively rare factual situations, interference with a contract not terminable at will may be justified or privileged and, therefore, proper even though intentional, see, e.g., Restatement (2d) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7770 (\"Actor Responsible for Welfare of Another\"), 772 (\"Advice as Proper or Improper Interference\"), 773 (\"Asserting Bona Fide Claim\"), 774 (\"Agreement Illegal or Contrary to Public Policy\").

See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7768, 769. The committee has therefore included in instructions 408.7 and 408.8 the substance of the issues to be considered in those situations.

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tThe Supreme Court of Florida stated that the claimant in Ethan Allen, Inc. v. Georgetown Manor, Inc., 647 So. 2d 812 (Fla. 1984), was entitled to the damages \"reasonably flowing\" from the defendant's interference with the claimant's existing business relationships. Id. at 815. Florida caselaw, however, does not delineate the types of damages that are recoverable for tortious interference claims.\n\n2.\tThe committee takes no position on the types of recoverable damages for tortious interference claims. One view is expressed by the Restatement (2d) of Torts \u00a7 774A. It provides for recovery of:\n\n(a)\tthe pecuniary loss of the benefits of the contract or the prospective relation;\n\n(b)\tconsequential losses for which the interference is a legal cause; and\n\n(c)\tactual harm to reputation, if it is reasonably to be expected to result from the interference.\n\nMoreover, subsection 774A(d) explains that the action for interference with contract is one in tort and damages are not based on contract rules, i.e., it is not required that the loss incurred be one within the contemplation of the parties to the contract itself at the time it was made. The claimant can also recover for consequential harms, provided they were legally caused by the defendant's interference.\n\n3.\tA problem with damages in the context of intentional interference claims is whether they can be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty. See general discussion in Restatement (2d) of Torts \u00a7 912, especially comments d and f. Florida has significant case law on the claimant's burden of proof on damages. See, e.g., Ethan Allen, 647 So. 2d at 812; Insurance Field Services, Inc. v. White and White Inspections and Audit Services, Inc., 384 So. 2d 303 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980); Ferguson Transportation, Inc. v.

Instruction 409.6b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether a misrepresentation was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his or her misrepresentation by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 409.6c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tThe jury will properly consider instruction 409.6a not only in determining whether defendant's misrepresentation is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's conduct contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3.\tInstruction 409.6b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury.\n\n4.\tInstruction 409.6c (intervening cause) embraces two situations in which a misrepresentation may be a legal cause notwithstanding the influence of an intervening cause: (1) when the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the misrepresentation although the other cause was not foreseeable, Mozer v. Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Gibson v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., 386 So. 2d 520 (Fla. 1980).\n\n5.\t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be instructed that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the misrepresentation. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts 291 (3d ed.); 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts 1137.\n\n6.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the instruction to describe the extent of contribution or influence a misrepresentation must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937)."

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tIn Gilchrist Timber Co. v. ITT Rayonier, Inc., 696 So. 2d 334 (Fla. 1997), the Supreme Court held that the doctrine of comparative negligence, as codified in F.S. 768.81, applied to an action for negligent misrepresentation as set forth in the Restatement (2d) Of Torts \u00a7552, which requires proof of justifiable reliance.\n\n2.\tIn Gilchrist Timber Co., the Court further noted that while the Restatement discusses the issue in terms of contributory negligence in \u00a7552A, a majority of the states that have adopted the comparative negligence doctrine and considered the issue agree that comparative negligence principles apply to cases involving negligent misrepresentation. See Gilchrist Timber Co., 696 So. 2d at 337. The committee recognizes that a logical tension could exist within a verdict determining that the claimant's reliance was justifiable, but that the claimant was also comparatively negligent (e.g., in relying on the statement by failing to conduct an adequate investigation). The committee also recognizes that justifiable reliance may involve a subjective standard distinct from the objective standard used in defining reasonable care. Restatement \u00a7545A, cmt. B (\"Justification is a matter of the qualities and characteristics of the particular plaintiff, and the circumstances of the particular case, rather than of the application of a community standard of conduct to all cases.\") Pending further development of the law, the committee reserves the question of the relationship, if any, between justifiable reliance and comparative negligence."

Instruction 412.7c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tThe jury will properly consider instruction 412.7a not only in determining whether defendant's negligence is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's negligence contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3.\tInstruction 412.7b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries/multiple events, instruction 501.5a or b should be given as well. See Hart v.

Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Gibson v.

The committee recommends that the jury not be instructed that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the negligence. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v.

Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937)."

(Plaintiff) is entitled to [recover benefits] [receive payment] if the service[s] [is] [are] related to the accident, the service[s] [is] [are] medically necessary, and the charge[s] for the service[s] [is] [are] reasonable.\n\n(Give the following preemptive instruction only where rulings or stipulations have altered the number of issues to be proven.)\n\nIn this case, there is no dispute that [the service[s] [is] [are] related to the accident] [and] [that the service[s] [is] [are] medically necessary] [and] [that the charge[s] [is] [are] reasonable], but there is dispute over [whether the service[s] [is] [are] related to the accident] [and] [whether the service[s] ]is] [are] medically necessary] [and] [whether the charge[s] for the service[s] [is] [are] reasonable].\n\n(Give the following instruction in all cases. Alter numbering where required due to rulings or stipulations.)\n\nTherefore, on this claim for personal injury benefits, you must decide the following:\n\nThe first issue is whether the service is related to the automobile accident of (date). If you decide that a service is not related to the accident, you should not award damages for that service. If you decide that one or more services are related to the accident, you must then decide a second issue.\n\nThe second issue is whether the service is medically necessary. If you decide that a service was not medically necessary, you should not award damages for that service. If you decide that one or more services are medically necessary, you must then decide a third issue.\n\nThe third issue is whether the charge is reasonable. If you find the charge for a service or services reasonable, you should award that amount as damages. If you find the charge for a service or services is not reasonable, you should award an amount that the greater weight of the evidence shows is reasonable.\n\nIn determining [these] [this] issue[s], you should apply the following definition[s]:\n\n(Give applicable definitions below.)\n\nb.\tServices:\n\nThe term \"services\" includes, but is not limited to, treatment, diagnostic studies, and supplies provided by the medical provider to the insured.\n\nc.\tMedically Necessary:\n\n\"Medically necessary\" refers to a medical service or supply that a prudent physician would provide for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing, or treating an illness, injury, disease, or symptom in a manner that is:\n\n(1)\tIn accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice;\n\n(2)\tClinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration; and,\n\n(3)\tNot primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician, or other health care provider.\n\nd.\tReasonable Charge:\n\nIn deciding whether the amount of a charge is reasonable, you may consider evidence of:\n\n(1)\tusual and customary charges and payments accepted by the provider involved in the dispute;\n\n(2)\treimbursement levels in the community;\n\n(3)\treimbursement levels in various federal and state medical fee schedules applicable to automobile coverages; and\n\n(4)\tany other evidence relevant to the reasonableness of the charges.\n\nYou may not, however, award an amount that exceeds the amount the provider customarily charges for like services or supplies.",
        "notes_on_use": "1.\tThis instruction assumes that the jury will be asked to decide the total amount of medical charges. It is anticipated that the judge will adjust this award in entering judgment to account for any payments previously made by the insurer, as well as for the effect of the 80% limitation in F.S. 627.736(1)(a), and any deductible.\n\n2.\tThe definition of \"medically necessary\" is based on F.S. 736.732(2) (2003). The committee has added the option of a \"prudent health care provider\" to this definition in anticipation that the phrase, \"prudent physician,\" as described in the statute could sometimes be inadequate. This statutory definition is somewhat complex. It is possible that the parties could agree upon a plainer and simpler definition.\n\n3.\tThe statutory description of what constitutes a reasonable amount may require a supplemental instruction for fee-capped diagnostic testing services as described in F.S. 627.736(5)(b) (2003).\n\n4.\tNo definition of \"related\" is provided in this instruction. Causation can be a complex issue in a PIP case. Generally, to invoke this insurance coverage a bodily injury must \"arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle.\" See F.S. 768.736(1) (2003); Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Castagna, 368 So. 2d 348 (Fla. 1979). The medical treatment covered by the insurance policy is the treatment that is related to the bodily injury arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the motor vehicle. The committee has been advised that most practitioners prefer to use the term, \"related,\" as a simple method to explain causation to the jury. The committee does not therefore intend for an instruction similar to F.S. 401.12 to be given in a PIP case as an explanation of causation."

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tInstruction 414.4a (legal cause generally) is to be given in all cases. Instruction 414.4b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether conduct was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his or her conduct by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 414.4c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\t The jury will properly consider instruction 414.4a not only in determining whether defendant's conduct is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's conduct contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3. \tInstruction 414.4b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries/multiple events, instruction 501.2h(1) or (2) should be given as well. See Hart v. Stern, 824 So. 2d 927, 929\u201332 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002); Marinelli v. Grace, 608 So. 2d 833, 834\u201335 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).\n\n4.\tInstruction 414.4c (intervening cause) embraces two situations in which conduct may be a legal cause notwithstanding the influence of an intervening cause: (1) when the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conduct although the other cause was not foreseeable, Mozer v. Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Ellingson v. Willis, 170 So. 2d 311 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964).\n\n5.\t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be charged that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the outrageous conduct. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts (3d ed.) 291; 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts 1137.\n\n6.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the charge to describe the extent of contribution or influence outrageous conduct must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 129 Fla. 355, 176 So. 495, 498 (1937).\n\n(Revised December 4, 2024.)"

        "main_paragraph": "On (claimant's) claim there is a preliminary issue for you to decide. That issue is whether (describe the alleged conduct) was an adverse employment action.\n\nAn adverse employment action is any action taken by the employer against the employee that amounts to a serious and material change in the employee's terms and conditions of employment.",
        "notes_on_use": "1.\tUse instruction 415.5 when plaintiff claims that the defendant took an adverse employment action other than discharge, demotion, or suspension and the defendant disputes that such action constitutes an adverse employment action.\n\n2.\tFlorida and federal courts have determined that an adverse employment action requires a serious and material change in the employee's terms and conditions of employment. Davis v. Town of Lake Park 245 F.3d 1232 (11th Cir. 2001) (to prove adverse employment action in a case under Title VII, an employee must show a serious and material change in the terms and conditions of employment), overruled on other ground by Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006). Courts have found that certain actions besides discharge, demotion, and suspension may constitute an adverse employment action under F.S. 448.101 and other similar federal and state employment law statutes. See, e.g., Finch v. Morgan Stanley & Co. LC, 2016 WL 4248248 (S.D. Fla. August 10, 2016) (denial of leave time may constitute an adverse employment action under Section 448.101); Miami-Dade County v. Eghbal, 54 So. 3d 525 (Fla. 3d DCA 2011) (denial of promotion is adverse employment action under Florida Civil Rights Act); Hill v. Branch Banking and Trust Co., 264 F. Supp. 3d 1247 (N.D. Ala. 2017) (negative performance valuations are only adverse employment actions under Title VII when a link can be shown between the review and an alteration of the terms of employment); Brown v. Snow, 440 F.3d 1259 (11th Cir. 2006) (a lower score on a performance evaluation, by itself, is not actionable unless the plaintiff can establish that the lower score led to a more tangible form of adverse action, such as ineligibility for promotional opportunities).\n\n(Adopted June 30, 2021.)"

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tThis instruction is based upon F.S. 760.10(7), which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer or other covered entity \"to discriminate against any person because that person has opposed any practice which is an unlawful employment practice under this section, or because that person has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this section.\"  This instruction can be modified to reflect the particular type of retaliatory treatment at issue. The instruction uses the language \"unlawful discrimination\" as easier to understand in place of the statutory language of \"an unlawful employment practice,\" but the latter language should be used if it better fits the facts of the case.\n\n2.\tFlorida law follows federal law in holding that adverse actions are not limited to employment actions against the claimant but can be other adverse actions that are retaliatory. See Gates v. Gadsden Cnty. Sch. Bd., 45 So. 3d 39, 41 (Fla. 1st DCA 2010) (citing Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997)); see also Donovan v. Broward Cnty.

Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 54 (2006)). If the claim is based on a non-employment action, the word \"employment\" in the phrase [takes an adverse [employment] action against] in the substantive paragraph will not be included.\n\n3.\tThis instruction permits the court to select appropriate options for the nature of the claimant (employee or job applicant), the type of adverse employment action(s) at issue, and the protected activity(ies) at issue.\n\n4.\tIn most cases, there is no dispute as to whether the employment action at issue (such as a discharge, failure to hire or failure to promote) is materially \"adverse.\" In some cases, however, there may be a dispute as to whether the allegedly retaliatory employment action is sufficiently material to constitute an \"adverse employment action.\" The option [takes an adverse [employment] action against] in the substantive instruction, derived from Burlington Northern, should only be used if such a dispute exists in the case. In this situation, instruction 417.48 should be given immediately after this one. By contrast, if the adverse employment action is one that is not specifically listed above but which has been agreed or determined to have been a materially adverse, then the adverse action will be specified in [(describe other adverse action)] with the use of the materiality instruction.\n\n(Adopted December 4, 2024.)"

White, 548 US 53, 68 (2006), in which the Court explained that the anti-retaliation provision prohibits more than just ultimate employment actions while also noting that \"it is important to separate significant from trivial harms.\" The Court held that the action must be materially adverse, \"which in this context means it well might have 'dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination'\" Id.

Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, (2001), Butler v. Ala. Dep't of Transp., 536 F.3d 1209, 1213 (11th Cir. 2008), and Tipton v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 872 F.2d 1491, 1494 (11th Cir. 1989).

Dept. of Law Enforcement, 868 F.2d 397, 401 (11th Cir. 1989) (\"This court has repeatedly recognized that some otherwise protected conduct may be so disruptive or inappropriate as to fall outside the statute's protection.

Traditionally, participation such as filing a charge or testifying in a proceeding has been considered absolutely protected by the majority of courts. See, e.g., Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 411 F.2d 998, 1007 (5th Cir. 1969). However, some courts have held participation unprotected where there was direct evidence of bad faith. See, e.g., Mattson v. Caterpillar, Inc., 359 F.3d 885, 890 (7th Cir. 2004). See also Carter, 989 So. 2d at 1264-65; Hinton, 942 So. 2d at 990 (discussing the issue).\n\n(Adopted December 4, 2024.)"

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tThis instruction uses \"because of,\" the causation language in F.S. 760.10(1). The committee takes no position on whether additional clarification is needed. We note that \"because of\" in employment statutes has been interpreted to mean numerous types of causation. See generally, \"Gross Disunity,\" 114 Penn. State L. Rev. 857 (2010) (\"because of\" can mean at least four different types of causation). Courts have focused on three possible meanings: \"sole,\" \"but for,\" and \"motivating factor.\" If an additional instruction is needed, it may vary depending on which protected factor is involved, as explained below.\n\n2.\tRace, color, religion, sex, national origin. No Florida appellate court has stated which causation standard should be used for a Florida Civil Rights Act (\"FCRA\") discrimination claim based on one of the five factors enumerated in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (\"Title VII\"). Florida courts have endorsed the general rule that, because the FCRA was patterned after Title VII, the Florida statute should be given the same construction as the federal courts give the federal act. See, e.g., Carsillo v. City of Lake Worth, 995 So. 2d 1118, 1119 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008). In 1991, Congress added the \"motivating factor\" causation standard to Title VII and added a \"same decision\" defense limiting damages. The Florida legislature never amended the FCRA to add the \"motivating factor\" causation standard and the \"same decision\" defense limiting damages.\n\n3.\tPregnancy. Title VII does not include \"pregnancy\" as a specifically enumerated factor.  However, Title VII, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, defines \"[t]he terms 'because of sex' or 'on the basis of sex'\" to include \"because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions[.]\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k). \"Under Title VII, a plaintiff may prevail on a [pregnancy discrimination] claim by showing that her pregnancy 'was a motivating factor' for an employment decision.\" Holland v. Gee, 677 F.3d 1047, 1055 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m)); Torres-Skair v. Medco Health Solutions, Inc., 595 Fed. Appx. 847, 852 (11th Cir. 2014) (same).\n\nThe Florida Legislature amended the FCRA to include pregnancy as a specifically enumerated factor, effective July 1, 2015. F.S. 760.10; Laws 2015, c. 2015-68, \u00a7 6. Prior to that amendment, the Florida Supreme Court held that the FCRA's prescription against discrimination because of \"sex\" includes discrimination based on pregnancy. Delva v. Continental Group, Inc., 137 So. 3d 371, 375 (Fla. 2014). No Florida appellate court has stated which causation standard should be used for an FCRA discrimination claim based on pregnancy. However, the \"motivating factor\" causation standard has been utilized in pregnancy discrimination claims brought concurrently under the FCRA and Title VII.  See, e.g., Gee, 677 F.3d at 1054\u20131055, 1058\u20131059, 1062\u20131063 (noting that decisions construing Title VII guide the analysis of the plaintiff-employee's pregnancy discrimination claim under the FCRA); Torres-Skair, 595 Fed. Appx. at 852\u2013853.\n\n4.\tAge. Courts have held that decisions construing the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) apply to the FCRA's age discrimination provision. See, e.g., Fla. State Univ. v. Sondel, 685 So. 2d 923 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996). The U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the ADEA to require \"but for\" causation. Gross v. FFL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 176 (2009).\n\n5.\tHandicap. Courts have held that decisions construing the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) apply to FCRA's handicap discrimination provision. See, e.g., Byrd v. BT Foods, Inc., 26 So. 3d 600 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010). There is a split among the federal circuits as to whether the ADA requires \"motivating factor\" or \"but for\" causation. Compare Pinkerton v. Spellings, 529 F.3d 513, 519 (5th Cir. 2008) (\"motivating factor\"), with Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp., 681 F.3d 312, 322 (6th Cir. 2012) (\"but for\").\n\n6.\tMarital Status. Marital status discrimination cases decided under the FCRA do not provide clear guidance on the causation standard to be applied. See Sanders v. Mayor's Jewelers, Inc., 942 F. Supp. 571 (S.D. Fla. 1996) (holding that complaint alleging \"discriminatory intent\" or marital status \"as motivating factor\" was sufficient to state a claim); Nat'l Indus., Inc. v. Comm'n on Human Relations, 527 So. 2d 894 (Fla. 5th DCA 1988) (holding that, because no record of the hearing was provided, the agency could not reject the hearing officer's finding that marital status was not \"a motivating factor\" and that no \"discriminatory intent\" was present).\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court has held that the term \"marital status,\" as used in the FCRA section prohibiting discrimination based on marital status, \"means the state of being married, single, divorced, widowed or separated, and does not include the specific identity or actions of an individual's spouse.\"  Donato v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 767 So. 2d 1146, 1154\u20131155 (Fla. 2000).\n\n7.\tThe committee takes no position as to whether a trial court should instruct on a permissive inference of pretext, that is, the employer's stated reason for the adverse employment action was not the real reason but was given to hide a discriminatory reason.  No Florida appellate decision has addressed the issue in a trial context.  At least one Florida appellate decision has employed the pretext consideration in the context of a summary judgment motion. See generally Feizi v. Dep't of Mgmt. Servs., 988 So. 2d 1192 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008) (reversing summary judgment where evidence was susceptible to a reasonable inference that the explanation offered by the defendant for eliminating plaintiff's job was pretextual). There is disagreement among the federal circuits as to whether a pretext instruction is required in employment discrimination cases under Title VII. See Ratliff v. City of Gainesville, 256 F.3d 355 (5th Cir. 2001) (error not to give pretext inference instruction), with Palmer v. Bd. of Regents, 208 F.3d 969 (11th Cir. 2000) (no error in refusing to instruct jury that it could infer discrimination if it believed plaintiff's prima facie case and disbelieved defendant's reason for adverse employment action).\n\n8.\tCat's Paw.  There is an additional theory of causation in federal discrimination cases referred to as the \"cat's paw.\"  This theory recognizes that, in certain situations, a biased supervisor's discriminatory animus may be the cause of the adverse employment action even though the actual decision-maker did not possess that discriminatory animus.  See Staub v. Proctor Hosp., 562 U.S. 411 (2011); Fla. Dep't of Children & Families v. Shapiro, 68 So. 3d 298, 306 (Fla. 4th DCA 2011).  If the cat's paw theory of causation applies, additional instructions may be necessary.  See, e.g., Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction 4.5.\n\n9.\tSame Actor Inference.  The law recognizes a permissible inference that discriminatory animus was not the cause of an adverse employment action when the person who hired the claimant is the same person who made the decision to take the adverse employment action.  See Brown Distributing Co. of West Palm Beach v. Marcell, 890 So. 2d 1227, 1232 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005); see also Williams v. Vitro Servs. Corp., 144 F.3d 1438, 1442\u201343 (11th Cir. 1998).  A Florida appellate court has held it is reversible error to refuse to give an instruction on the \"same actor\" inference when it has been requested and applies to the circumstances of the case.  See, e.g., Brown Distributing Co., 890 So. 2d at 1232.  Additional instructions may thus be necessary based on the circumstances of a particular case."

The court may award \"compensatory damages, including, but not limited to, damages for mental anguish, loss of dignity, and other intangible injuries\u2026.\" F.S. 760.11(5). Examples of \"other intangible injuries\" for which damages have been awarded under the FCRA include \"emotional distress,\" Munoz v. Oceanside Resorts, Inc., 223 F.3d 1340, 1348\u201349 (11th Cir. 2000); \"emotional injury,\" City of Hollywood v. Hogan, 986 So. 2d 634, 649\u201350 (4th DCA 2008); \"humiliation and embarrassment,\" Melluzzo v. Pub. Advocate, 2006 WL 5159197, at *3 (M.D. Fla. 2006); \"pain and suffering\" and \"loss of capacity for enjoyment of life experienced in the past or to be experienced in the future,\" Moses v. K-Mart Corp., 905 F. Supp. 1054, 1060 n.7 (S.D. Fla. 1995), aff'd 119 F.3d 10 (11th Cir. 1997). In a harassment case where there has been no tangible employment action taken against the claimant, a claimant may still recover such damages as compensation for the impact of the harassment. See, e.g., Sornia v. El Centro Elementary Sch.Dist., 285 Fed.Appx. 337 (9th Cir. 2008) and Harris v. L & L Wings, Inc., 132 F.3d 978 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\n3.\tPunitive Damages. This instruction does not include punitive damages. Pending further development of the law, the committee takes no position as to whether the Florida standard or the heightened federal standard for holding an employer vicariously liable for punitive damages for the conduct of its employee should apply. See Speedway SuperAmerica, LLC v. DuPont, 933 So. 2d 75 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006) (certifying the question of whether the state or federal standard applies), review dismissed 955 So. 2d 533 (Fla. 2007). The court may award punitive damages not to exceed $100,000. F.S. 760.11(5).\n\n\"Under Florida law, the purpose of punitive damages is not to further compensate the plaintiff, but to punish the defendant for its wrongful conduct and to deter similar misconduct by it and other actors in the future.\" Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Ballard, 749 So. 2d 483, 486 (Fla. 1999). However, \"it is not clear what the standard is for punitive damages awarded under section 760.10,\" DuPont, 933 So. 2d at 89, and the committee takes no position as to the standard for determining whether punitive damages are warranted. The FCRA, unlike Title VII, \"simply provides that punitive damages may be awarded,\" without any express requirement as to what action is appropriate for punitive damage. Id. at 89\u201390.\n\nSome federal courts have applied Title VII's punitive damages standard to claims for punitive damages under the FCRA. See, e.g., Hipp v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., 65 F. Supp. 2d 1314 (M.D. Fla. 1999), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds 252 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir. 2001). \"To recover punitive damages under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove that defendant has 'engaged in discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.'\" Richardson v. Tricom Pictures & Productions, Inc., 334 F. Supp. 2d 1303, 1319 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(1)). \"Malice or reckless indifference is shown when the employer knowingly violates federal law. . . .\" Id. at 1319\u20131320 (citing Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 535, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1999)). \"[A]n employer must at least discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law.\" Kolstad, 527 U.S. at 535; Richardson, 334 F. Supp. 2d at 1320.\n\n(Revised December 4, 2024.)"

Marcell, 890 So. 2d 1227 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005) (finding that the trial court erred by not giving the defendant-employer's proposed jury instruction on after-acquired evidence, which was \"a fair reading of the holding in McKennon and therefore appropriate as it accurately states the law and is necessary for the jury to properly resolve the issues of the case\"); Torres v.

After-acquired evidence should not be used to determine liability because \"[t]he employer could not have been motivated by the knowledge it did not have and it cannot now claim that the employee was fired for the nondiscriminatory reason.\"  McKennon v. Nashville Banner Pub. Co., 513 U.S. 352, 360, 115 S. Ct. 879, 130 L. Ed. 2d 852 (1995).  See also Crapp v. City of Miami Beach, 242 F.3d 1017, 1021 (11th Cir. 2001).\n\n3.\tMisconduct in job application process. The Eleventh Circuit has held \"that the after-acquired evidence rule announced in McKennon applies to cases in which the after-acquired evidence concerns the employee's misrepresentations in a job application or resume, as well as cases in which the after-acquired evidence relates to employee wrongdoing during employment.\"  Wallace v. Dunn Const. Co., Inc., 62 F.3d 374, 379 (11th Cir. 1995).  See also Neal, 2001 WL 1923127, at *14 (applying the after-acquired evidence defense where the plaintiff intentionally falsified her employment application); Yeary v.

After-acquired evidence does not reduce or preclude an award of compensatory damages even where such evidence reduces or precludes back pay and reinstatement.  Crapp, 242 F.3d at 1021 (holding that the court's decision to deny the plaintiff \"backpay for a discriminatory termination and yet award him compensatory damages for that termination\" was appropriate and consistent with McKennon).  \"Resolution of the [problem of after-acquired evidence] must give proper recognition to the fact that [unlawful discrimination] has occurred which must be deterred and compensated without undue infringement upon the employer's rights and prerogatives.\"  McKennon, 513 U.S. at 362."

See Rice-Lamar v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, 853 So. 2d 1125 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003) (Title VII retaliation analysis applied to claim arising under Florida's Whistle-blower Act); Carter v. Health Mgmt.

Nassar, 570 U.S. 338 (2013) (Title VII's retaliation provision requires \"but for\" causation that employer took adverse employment action \"because\" employee engaged in protected activity); Palm Beach County Sch. Bd. v. Wright, 217 So. 3d 163 (Fla. 4th DCA 2017) (en banc) (applying Nassar to Florida Civil Rights Act claim, rejecting the \"wholly unrelated\" causation standard, because the Florida statute was patterned after the federal statute); Vill. of Tequesta v.

Instruction 420.5b (concurring cause), to be given when the court considers it necessary, does not set forth any additional standard for the jury to consider in determining whether negligence was a legal cause of damage but only negates the idea that a defendant is excused from the consequences of his or her negligence by reason of some other cause concurring in time and contributing to the same damage. Instruction 420.5c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tThe jury will properly consider instruction 420.5a not only in determining whether defendant's negligence is actionable but also in determining whether claimant's negligence contributed as a legal cause to claimant's damage, thus reducing recovery.\n\n3.\tInstruction 420.5b must be given whenever there is a contention that some other cause may have contributed, in whole or part, to the occurrence or resulting injury. If there is an issue of aggravation of a preexisting condition or of subsequent injuries/multiple events, instructions 501.5a or 501.5b should be given as well. See Hart v. Stern, 824 So. 2d 927, 929\u201332 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002); Marinelli v. Grace, 608 So. 2d 833, 834\u201335 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).\n\n4.\tInstruction 420.5c (intervening cause) embraces two situations in which negligence may be a legal cause notwithstanding the influence of an intervening cause: (1) when the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the negligence although the other cause was not foreseeable, Mozer v. Semenza, 177 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965), and (2) when the intervention of the other cause was itself foreseeable, Gibson v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., 386 So. 2d 520 (Fla. 1980).\n\n5. \t\"Probable\" results. The committee recommends that the jury not be instructed that the damage must be such as would have appeared \"probable\" to the actor or to a reasonably careful person at the time of the negligence. In cases involving an intervening cause, the term \"reasonably foreseeable\" is used in place of \"probable.\" The terms are synonymous and interchangeable. See Sharon v. Luten, 165 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 1st DCA 1964); Prosser, Torts 291 (3d ed.); 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts, 1137.\n\n6.\tThe term \"substantially\" is used throughout the instruction to describe the extent of contribution or influence negligence must have in order to be regarded as a legal cause. \"Substantially\" was chosen because the word has an acceptable common meaning and because it has been approved in Florida as a test of causation not only in relation to defendant's negligence, Loftin v. Wilson, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953), but also in relation to plaintiff's comparative negligence, Shayne v. Saunders, 176 So. 495, 498 (Fla. 1937).\n\n(Revised December 4, 2024.)"

Instruction 452.5c (intervening cause) is to be given only in cases in which the court concludes that there is a jury issue as to the presence and effect of an intervening cause.\n\n2.\tWhile legal cause of damage is not an element of the tort, it is necessary to instruct on legal cause when the claimant seeks more than nominal damages.

If you decide that (claimant) was injured by (defendant) and was later injured by another event, then you should try to separate the damages caused by the two events and award (claimant) money only for those damages caused by (defendant). However, if you cannot separate some or all of the damages, you must award (claimant) any damages that you cannot separate as if they were all caused by (defendant).\n\nc.

        "notes_on_use": "1.\tDesigning a standard instruction for reduction of damages to present value is complicated by the fact that there are several different methods used by economists and courts to arrive at a present-value determination. See, for example, Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Ageloff, 552 So. 2d 1089 (Fla. 1989), and Renuart Lumber Yards v.

See Seaboard Coast Line Railroad v. Burdi, 427 So. 2d 1048 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).\n\n3.\tThis instruction conflicts with F.S. 768.77(2)(a)2.

See Greyhound Corp. v. Ford, 157 So. 2d 427 (Fla. 2d DCA 1963); Paradis v. Thomas, 150 So. 2d 457 (Fla. 2d DCA 1963). See F.S. 768.76, 1986 supplement, concerning particular collateral source deductions by the court.\n\n2.\tInstruction 501.8b, not instruction 501.8a, should be given in all actions for personal injury or wrongful death accruing before October 1, 1993, arising out of the ownership, operation, use, or maintenance of a motor vehicle. Instruction 501.8b is derived from F.S. 627.7372 (1987), which was repealed for causes of action accruing on or after October 1, 1993. Ch. 93-245, \u00a73, Laws of Fla. That statute specified which benefits are defined as collateral sources and which are specifically excluded from the definition.\n\n3.\tIn most cases, the parties will agree that PIP setoffs are to be applied by the court post-trial. Absent such an agreement, in all actions for personal injury or wrongful death accruing on or after October 1, 1993, arising out of the ownership, operation, use, or maintenance of a motor vehicle, in which evidence is presented that personal injury protection benefits have been paid or are payable, instruction 501.8c should be given. See F.S. 627.736(3); Caruso v. Baumle, 880 So. 2d 540 (Fla. 2004). The bracketed language that constitutes the last sentence of the first paragraph of instruction 501.8c should be given only when personal injury protection benefits are payable for incurred expenses that have not yet been processed or paid by the personal injury protection insurer at the time of trial. See Rollins v. Pizzarelli, 761 So. 2d 294 (Fla. 2000). It appears that \"payable\" personal injury protection benefits do not include benefits for incurred expenses that have been submitted to, but contested by, the PIP insurer at the time of trial, or in situations where the PIP insurer is insolvent at the time of trial. Compare Rollins, 761 So. 2d at 299\u2013300. Pending further development of the law, however, the committee takes no position as to whether the bracketed last sentence of instruction 501.8c should be given in such circumstance."

Wells Fargo Services, Inc., 678 So. 2d 1262 (Fla. 1996). The second paragraph of this instruction should be used to inform the jury of the appropriate procedure, so the jury does not make inappropriate adjustments to its verdict. There is support for giving a special instruction explaining to the jury the impact and effect of F.S. 768.81 apportionment of liability in such cases. See Slawson v. Fast Food Enterprises, 671 So. 2d 255, 260 (Fla. 4th DCA 1996); Seminole Gulf Railway Limited Partnership v.

However, it may also be necessary to have a specific determination by the jury of the survivor's comparative negligence, which would be applied only to reduce that survivor's recovery.

See, for example, Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Ageloff, 552 So. 2d 1089 (Fla. 1989), and Renuart Lumber Yards v. Levine, 49 So. 2d 97 (Fla. 1950) (using approach similar to calculation of cost of annuity); Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. v.

See Seaboard Coast Line Railroad v. Burdi, 427 So. 2d 1048 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).\n\n3.\tThis instruction conflicts with F.S. 768.77(2)(a)2. and should not be given in medical malpractice cases when a party has requested that future damages be paid in periodic payments.\n\n(Revised April 21, 2016.)"

In evaluating the believability of any witness and the weight you will give the testimony of any witness, you may properly consider the demeanor of the witness while testifying; the frankness or lack of frankness of the witness; the intelligence of the witness; any interest the witness may have in the outcome of the case; the means and opportunity the witness had to know the facts about which the witness testified; the ability of the witness to remember the matters about which the witness testified; and the reasonableness of the testimony of the witness, considered in the light of all the evidence in the case and in the light of your own experience and common sense.\n\nb.\tExpert witnesses:\n\n[You have heard opinion testimony [on certain technical subjects] from [a person] [persons] referred to as [an] expert witness[es].] [Some of the testimony before you was in the form of opinions about certain technical subjects.]\n\nYou may accept such opinion testimony, reject it, or give it the weight you think it deserves, considering the knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education of the witness, the reasons given by the witness for the opinion expressed, and all the other evidence in the case.\n\nc.\tWitness talked to lawyer:\n\n[It is entirely proper for a lawyer to talk to a witness about what testimony the witness would give if called to the courtroom. The witness should not be discredited just because the witness talked with a lawyer about [his] [her] testimony.]",

Except to the extent indicated in instruction 601.2, the committee recommends that the jury not be instructed that the jurors may bring to bear their \"common knowledge and everyday experience.\"\n\n3.\tFailure to produce witness.

While it may be permissible in some circumstances to instruct the jury regarding inferences arising from a party's failure to produce a witness (compare Weeks v.

Perry, 326 F.2d 921 (5th Cir. 1964)), the committee believes that generally such inferences are more properly referred to in counsel's argument.\n\n4.\tWitness talked to lawyer. This may be given if requested as either a substantive or a curative instruction whenever there is testimony that a witness spoke to or met with an attorney for one of the parties.

However, you may speak to the lawyers or anyone else about the trial. You also have the right to refuse to speak with anyone. A request may come from those who are simply curious, or from those who might seek to find fault with you. It will be up to you to decide whether to preserve your privacy as a juror.\n\n(In discharging the jury, the court should advise them of their further responsibilities, if any.)",
